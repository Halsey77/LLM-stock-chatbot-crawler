{'title': 'Snowflake Hacker Still Active, Finding New Victims, Expert Says', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- A hacker responsible for a cybercrime campaign that impacted up to 165 companies this summer is still at large and recently broke into a “handful” of new organizations, according to a cybersecurity specialist at Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Most Read from Bloomberg The attacker, who previously stole data from customers of cloud analytics company Snowflake Inc., has since targeted American firms and compromised critical infrastructure organizations based in Russia and Bangladesh, according to Austin Larsen, senior threat analyst at Google who’s been investigating the campaign for months. US victims are in the health care, technology and telecommunications industries, Larsen said. That such a prolific hacker has evaded law enforcement despite bragging about the attacks to journalists and security researchers in recent months exemplifies the challenge that cross-border cybercrime poses to law enforcement, thanks to anonymizing communication services and a burgeoning criminal market for stolen credentials. An analysis of the hacker’s online interactions indicated they were likely a male based in Canada in their 20s who displayed Nazi sympathies, Larsen said. He declined to identify the hacker by name or say if their identity had been passed on to law enforcement. The hacker recently shared screenshots of records stolen from Russian and Bangladeshi critical infrastructure companies on Telegram, including sensitive customer data, Larsen said. Some intrusions are ongoing, he added. The attacker gained access to victim organizations by logging onto internet-based login portals or services using stolen passwords purchased on the dark web. The hacker, who Larsen said may be working with others, has a “huge amount of stolen credentials” at least totaling in the hundreds of thousands from numerous organizations around the world. Once inside they could steal data and extort victims, Larsen warned. “The actor continues to cause harm, compromise additional companies and extort, in some cases,” Larsen said. In June and July, companies including AT&T Inc., Live Nation Entertainment Inc. and Advanced Auto Parts Inc. disclosed they’d been affected as part of a campaign in which a hacker stole personal data about millions of people. The cybercrime campaign occurred after a hacker broke into misconfigured Snowflake systems to access sensitive data. The hacker is no longer targeting Snowflake-related data but exploiting tools from another software provider, which Larsen declined to name. Larsen presented his findings on Friday at the LABScon cyber conference in Arizona. In June, a person claiming to be the same hacker — and using a pseudonym verified by Larsen — told Bloomberg News over an online chat that they expected to be paid $20 million for the full suite of Snowflake customer data. There’s no evidence to suggest anyone purchased the set. At one point, the hacker made a mistake by posting a video that revealed some technical infrastructure, which Mandiant, a cyber unit of Google Cloud, used to help identify them, Larsen said.

{'title': 'Mortgage rates inch closer to 6% following Fed rate cut', 'content': 'Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates fell again this week to 6.09%, though the move wasn’t directly tied to the Federal Reserve’s rate cut on Wednesday. The average rate dropped 0.11 percentage point from a week earlier, according to Freddie Mac data released Thursday, leaving the average at the lowest level since early February 2023. Fifteen-year mortgage rates also fell, to 5.15% from 5.27% a week ago. In recent months, mortgage rates have dropped more than a percentage point in anticipation of the Fed’s move. At its meeting Wednesday, the central bank cut benchmark interest rates by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5% and indicated it plans to lower rates twice more by the end of the year. Headed into the meeting, traders were divided on how much the Fed would cut, but the central bank’s decision to make a larger reduction wasn’t enough of a surprise to move mortgage rates materially — nor is it likely to drive them   from here, said Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist at Zillow. “The markets really expected the current scenario,” Divounguy said. “Mortgage rates moved lower ahead of the Fed meeting. That has improved housing affordability.” After a very slow summer, there are signs that buyers are beginning to take notice of the lower rates.   for home purchases and refinancings jumped more than 14% from a week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Refinancing applications were particularly strong, more than doubling from the same period a year ago as homeowners seek to lower their monthly payments. The MBA estimated average 30-year mortgage rates at 6.15% for the week that ended on Friday. In August,   slipped 2.5% from July to an annual rate of 3.86 million, according to the National Association of Realtors. Median home prices hit $416,700 last month, a 3.1% increase from a year earlier. “Mortgage rates continued declining towards the 6% mark, reviving purchase and refinance demand for many consumers,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement. “While mortgage rates do not directly follow moves by the Federal Reserve, this first cut in over four years will have an impact on the housing market.”', 'date': '2024-09-19', 'time': '19:52:16.000', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mortgage-rates-inch-closer-to-6-following-fed-rate-cut-160309788.html'}

{'title': 'Average rate on a 30-year mortgage falls to 6.09%, lowest level since early February 2023', 'content': 'The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. edged closer to 6% this week to its lowest level since early February 2023. The rate fell to 6.09% from 6.20% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 7.19%. The last time the average rate was this low was on February 2, 2023. Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners seeking to refinance their home loan to a lower rate, also eased this week. The average rate fell to 5.15% from 5.27% last week. A year ago, it averaged 6.54%, Freddie Mac said. Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including how the bond market reacts to the Fed’s interest rate policy decisions. That can move the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans. Rates have been mostly easing since July as   and   raised expectations of a Fed cut, sending the yield on the 10-year Treasury lower. That rate cut arrived Wednesday, as the   for the first time in more than four years. Fed officials also signaled they expect further cuts this year and in 2025 and 2026. The rate cuts should, over time, lead to lower borrowing costs on mortgages. The latest pullback in rates should help spur demand for refinancing and home purchase loans, said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. “While mortgage rates do not directly follow moves by the Federal Reserve, this first cut in over four years will have an impact on the housing market," Khater said. "Declining mortgage rates over the last several weeks indicate this cut was mostly baked in, but we expect rates to fall further, sparking more housing activity.” After climbing to a  , the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has hovered around 7% for most of this year — more than double what it was just three years ago. The elevated mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, have put off many would-be homebuyers, extending the nation’s housing slump into its third year.  Still, as rates have eases, more homeowners have applied for loans to refinance their mortgage. Refinance loan applications surged 24% last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Economists generally expect mortgage rates to remain near their current levels, at least this year. Fannie Mae said this week it projects the rate on a 30-year mortgage will average 6.2% in the October-December quarter and decline to an average of 5.7% in the same quarter next year.

{'title': 'US 30-year fixed-rate mortgage falls to 6.09%', 'content': 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage rates dropped to the lowest level in more than 1-1/2 years this week and could fall further after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time since 2020. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.09%, the lowest since February 2023, from 6.20% last week, mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac said in a statement on Thursday. It averaged 7.19% during the same period a year ago. The average rate on the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 5.15%, also the lowest reading since February 2023, from 5.27% last week. That compared to an average of 6.54% a year ago. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday cut its benchmark overnight interest rate by 50 basis points to the 4.75%-5.00% range. Lower borrowing costs are unlikely to have a major impact on the housing market this year, though declining mortgage rates could encourage more homeowners to put their homes on the market. Most home owners have mortgage rates below 4% and the so-called "rate lock" starved the market for previously owned homes of supply. Lower borrowing costs could, however, stimulate demand that outpaces supply, keeping house prices elevated. Mortgage finance agency Fannie Mae on Wednesday estimated that existing homes sales this year would be the lowest since 1995, citing affordability challenges.

Nike said Thursday that Elliott Hill, a former Nike executive who retired in 2020, will return to the company as the CEO and president on Oct. 14. John Donahoe, Nike\'s current CEO, will retire effective Oct. 13 and will remain an adviser to the company until January 2025. Before retiring, Hill was president of Nike\'s consumer and marketplace business, leading commercial and marketing operations for Nike and the Jordan brand. "Given our needs for the future, the past performance of the business, and after conducting a thoughtful succession process, the Board concluded it was clear Elliott’s global expertise, leadership style, and deep understanding of our industry and partners, paired with his passion for sport, our brands, products, consumers, athletes, and employees, make him the right person to lead Nike’s next stage of growth,” Nike executive chairman Mark Parker  The news comes as Nike stock has stumbled this year, falling more than 25% amid slowing revenue growth and concerns about the success of the company\'s pivot to direct-to-consumer sales. "This is very good news for the stock, both the executive named as well as the timing," Bernstein senior analyst Aneesha Sherman told Yahoo Finance. "Elliott Hill has worked at Nike for 32 years. He\'s a product guy. He\'s ran retail in [Europe, Middle East, Africa] and US in North America. He knows the company and the product very well." The stock fell 20% in June when the company reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings and said it expects revenue to decline more than it previously thought in the coming year. The company said quarterly revenue in the fourth quarter fell 2% from the year prior to $12.61 billion, below Wall Street\'s estimates for $12.86 billion. Meanwhile, Nike\'s $0.99 earnings per share exceeded analysts\' expectations of $0.66. Nike\'s direct-to-consumer sales declined 8% from the same quarter a year ago to $5.1 billion.

The index is up 0.8% so far in September, historically the weakest month for stocks, and has gained 19% year-to-date. But the rocky period could carry over until the Nov 5 election, strategists said, leaving the S&P 500 vulnerable to market swings. "We\'re entering that period where seasonality has been a bit less favorable,” said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. "Despite the excitement about the start of the new rate-cutting cycle, it could still be a bumpy road ahead." The second half of September is historically the weakest two-week period of the year for the S&P 500, according to a Ned Davis Research analysis of data since 1950. The index has also logged an average 0.45% decline in October during presidential years, data from CFRA going back to 1945 showed. Volatility also tends to pick up in October in election years, with the Cboe Market Volatility index rising to an average level of 25 at the start of the month, as opposed to its long-term average of 19.2, according to an Edward Jones analysis of the past eight presidential election years. The VIX was recently at 16.4. The market could be particularly sensitive to this year\'s close election between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. Recent polls show a virtually tied race. "Unless the data deteriorates considerably, we think U.S . elections will start to be more at the forefront," UBS equity derivative strategists said in a note. Investors are also looking for data to support expectations that the economy is navigating a "soft landing," during which inflation moderates without badly hurting growth. Stocks fare much better after the start of rate cuts in such a scenario, as opposed to when the Fed cuts during recessions. The coming week includes reports on manufacturing, consumer confidence and durable goods, as well as the personal consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation measure. Attention will be squarely on employment after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank wanted to stay ahead of any weakening in the job market as the Fed announced its cut this week. The closely-watched monthly U.S. jobs report is due on Oct 4. "We\'re going to have hyper-focus on anything that speaks to the strength of the labor force," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. Meanwhile, the rally in stocks has pushed up valuations. The S&P 500 has a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.4 times expected 12-month earnings, well above its long-term average of 15.7, according to LSEG Datastream. With the scope for valuations to go higher now more limited, investors said that puts a greater burden on corporate earnings to be strong in order to support stock gains. Third-quarter reporting season kicks off next month. S&P 500 earnings for the period are expected to have climbed 5.4% from the prior year, and then jump nearly 13% in the fourth quarter, according to LSEG IBES. FedEx shares tumbled on Friday after the delivery giant reported a steep quarterly profit drop and lowered its full-year revenue forecast. "Extended multiples put pressure on macro data and fundamentals to support S&P 500 prices," Scott Chronert, head of U.S. equity strategy at Citi, said in a report.

{'title': 'Fake Names Lured Billionaire Salinas Into Loan Scam, Lawyers Say', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Lawyers for Ricardo Salinas Pliego unveiled new details Friday of the loan agreement they allege was part of a scam to con the Mexican billionaire out of hundreds of millions of dollars. Most Read from Bloomberg In a London court hearing, attorneys documented how a financial adviser for Salinas and an employee at one of his companies helped arrange a loan for a Salinas firm in 2021 that eventually totaled $110 million. Salinas’ lawyers allege that representatives for the lender, an affiliate of Astor Asset Management, used fake names and gave the false impression that their firm was related to the fabled Astor family of Gilded Age New York. In exchange for the loan, the billionaire offered up more than $400 million in shares of his Grupo Elektra SAB as collateral. The stock was placed in the custody of brokers who then transferred them to the lender, unbeknownst to Salinas, his attorneys allege. Most of that stock was sold in small increments over the course of almost three years, despite account statements that showed it was still being held by the broker, Salinas’ lawyers said in court documents. Some of the proceeds were used to fund Astor’s loans to Salinas, his lawyers alleged. After winning an initial ruling earlier this year freezing any remaining shares held by the lender and proceeds of share sales, Salinas’ lawyers are asking the court to ignore a request by Astor to lift the order and free the assets. The court has yet to issue a new ruling. In a separate filing Friday, Astor said the 2021 agreement with Salinas gave it the right to access the billionaire’s shares held as collateral. The fund made it clear to Salinas’ financial adviser in September 2021 that the shares held in collateral would be traded, Astor’s attorneys said. “To pretend that unfavorable provisions or provisions permitting share lending do not apply to Mr. Salinas is appalling,” said Vladimir Sklarov, who is named as a defendant along with Astor and is described by Salinas’ lawyers as the person with principal responsibility for the lender. In an email Friday, Sklarov said most of his firm’s borrowers understand the terms of their loans. Salinas’ legal team said — and Astor’s lawyers acknowledged — that Sklarov used an alias in his dealings with the billionaire’s representatives. To them, he was known as Gregory Mitchell. Another person representing Astor in the loan agreement called himself Thomas Mellon but was really a Russian associate of Sklarov’s, according to Salinas’ attorneys. ‘Puff Piece’ To demonstrate why Salinas thought he was dealing with a prestigious family, his lawyers pointed to a “puff piece” online that refers to Thomas Mellon as a descendant of the Astors who is seeking to live up to their legacy. At the time the billionaire agreed to the deal in 2021, he had been seeking to refinance a loan with BNP Paribas, according to the court documents. A financial adviser the billionaire has worked with in the past was approached by an intermediary who connected him to Astor, the documents say. Salinas, 68, has said that he’s unable to get the shares back despite offering to pay the loan in full. Elektra shares on the Mexican stock exchange have been suspended from trading since July 26 because of Salinas’ claim of the alleged fraud. The company was removed from Mexico’s benchmark stock index by S&P Dow Jones Indices last month due to the prolonged trading suspension, which sets up shares for a sharp drop when they resume trading and index-linked funds seek to sell holdings. Sklarov has been sued in the past over claims that he used the names of financial institutions and famous families. Sklarov was accused by Barclays Plc of infringing on the Lehman Brothers trademark to pursue fraudulent schemes. Rothschild Group filed a similar suit against Sklarov in 2019. Court records show that both suits were settled with Sklarov agreeing not to use the Lehman Brothers or Rothschild names. Sklarov was convicted in 1997 in the US of fraud involving Medicare and sentenced to one year in prison. In an email, Sklarov acknowledged the conviction and said the case was about interpretation of Medicare guidelines that weren’t consistent in different states. --With assistance from Steve Stroth.

{'title': 'AI is helping shape the 2024 presidential race. But not in the way experts feared', 'content': "WASHINGTON (AP) — With the 2024 election looming, the first since the mass popularization of generative artificial intelligence,  : social media flooded with   that were so realistic, baffled voters wouldn’t know what to believe. So far, that hasn’t happened. Instead, what voters are seeing is far more absurd: A video of former President Donald Trump riding a cat while wielding an assault rifle. A mustachioed Vice President Kamala Harris dressed in communist attire. Trump and Harris sharing a passionate embrace. AI is playing a major role in the presidential campaign, even if the greatest fears about how it could threaten the U.S. presidential election haven’t materialized yet.   regularly ricochet around the web, but many of them are so cartoonish and absurd that even the most naïve viewer couldn’t take them seriously. Still, even these memes can be problematic. Eye-catching AI-generated photos and videos, some striving to be funny, have become useful tools for spreading false, sometimes racist messages with a clear political bent — and candidates and their supporters are among those sharing them on social media. For example, Trump and many of his allies not only repeatedly promoted the   that Haitian migrants are stealing and eating cats and dogs in Springfield, Ohio, they also spread related AI-generated memes. One shared by Trump’s Truth Social account showed him on a luxury jet, surrounded by cats and white ducks. Another showed a group of kittens holding a sign that read, “DON’T LET THEM EAT US, Vote for Trump!” Francesca Tripodi, an expert in online propaganda, said such AI-made images are new, viral vehicles to carry age-old anti-immigration narratives. “The memes that are amplifying this claim are anything but humorous. When you have elected officials who are utilizing this imagery as a way of perpetuating racism and xenophobia, that’s a huge problem,” said Tripodi, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Republicans defend the images as lighthearted jokes — and byproducts of Trump’s personality. “There is a culture of personality surrounding Donald Trump that encourages that sort of over-the-top communication style that turns things into comical memes,” said Caleb Smith, a Republican strategist. “The intent is to entertain, not to deceive. That is what it should be.” Not just Trump supporters Trump and his supporters aren’t the only ones creating AI memes, but they appear to be using AI image generators more than their Democratic counterparts. Some left-leaning users have posted AI images making fun of billionaire Elon Musk, the owner of X and an outspoken supporter of Trump’s campaign. Democrats also   of Trump in handcuffs and being chased by police when he was in court in Manhattan last year. But Kamala Harris’ campaign has not leaned into amplifying AI-generated content, sticking instead to TikTok trends and other memes that don’t require AI models to create. “Currently, the only authorized campaign use of generative AI is for productivity tools, such as data analysis and industry-standard coding assistance,” said Harris campaign spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung did not respond to specific questions from The Associated Press but said its strategy had not changed since May, when he provided an emailed statement saying the campaign did not “engage or utilize” tools supplied by any AI company. Using fake, entertaining, often preposterous images to score political points is hardly new. But unlike cobbled-together Photoshop images or political cartoons, AI-generated images pack a stronger punch with their hyperrealism and can draw new attention to a political message. While some of the images related to pets in Springfield were cartoonish and silly, many felt they perpetuated a damaging conspiracy theory about a community that has since received   prompting evacuations of schools and government buildings. “Memes that are obviously parody are one thing. It’s another where it’s obviously intended to deceive,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and vocal Trump critic. “And we already see the Trump campaign really blurring the line.” AI makes it easy The speed and accessibility of generative AI tools make it easy to create outlandish political content that can drive clicks and likes. With AI image generators accessible to anyone with an internet connection, they are a cheap and convenient way for campaigns to respond to online trends and hammer home a message. “Campaigns have had to deal with disinformation and misinformation for a very long time. … It’s not a new problem. But obviously what AI allows is for this stuff to do done more rapidly, perhaps more convincingly, and in a more targeted environment,” said Teddy Goff, the digital director of Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. Paul Ingrassia, a New York-based political commentator and lawyer, said he spun up a viral image of Trump emerging from a lion’s den in seconds by prompting Grok, then dropped it into his newsletter and sent it to Trump campaign staffers. Trump’s Truth Social account posted Ingrassia’s newsletter, including the image, that day. “I got a message from my point of contact with the president and they said: ‘The president loved the image, how did you make it? Who created it?’ And I said: ‘Oh, I did. I made that for the article,’” Ingrassia said. “And he said, ‘Keep up the great work, he loves it.’” The use of AI for political satire and propaganda isn’t limited to the U.S. and  . More sinister deepfakes also have sought to influence races around the world. In Slovakia last year, AI audio clips impersonated the liberal party chief talking about rigging the vote days before parliamentary elections. In New Hampshire's primary in January, audio deepfakes of President Joe Biden were  , urging them not to vote. The incident was quickly publicized and  . Trump’s embrace of AI-generated images counters some of his past commentary. In an interview on Fox Business this year, Trump called artificial intelligence “very dangerous” and “so scary” because “there’s no real solution” to the issues created by the advancing technology. And some Republicans have fretted about how Trump and the GOP are using AI to create political memes. “I don’t engage in memes. I never have. I never will,” said Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican in a competitive district outside Philadelphia. “I just don’t believe in it.” ___ Swenson reported from New York. ___ This story is part of an Associated Press series, “The AI Campaign,” exploring the influence of artificial intelligence in the 2024 election cycle. ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

{'title': "Bitcoin's volatility intensifies as Fed slashes interest rates ahead of 2024 election", 'content': 'Bitcoin’s price volatility, alongside the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points, has raised questions about the future of the cryptocurrency. With many expecting a smaller cut, the larger reduction has led to speculation on its impact, particularly as the U.S. election draws near. Roundtable anchor Rob Nelson discussed these developments with David Packham, CEO of  , to explore what this means for bitcoin in both the short and long term. "It\'s generally bullish for the economy," said David Packham. "We typically see a strong correlation between bitcoin\'s price movements and the general macro economy. This rate cut lowers borrowing costs, and its impact will be felt in three to six months. For businesses and consumers, it’s going to reduce the cost of loans and variable-rate debt, which is much needed after years of inflation." Packham also commented on the political timing of the rate cut. "Some on the right are pointing fingers at the Fed, questioning their impartiality," he said. However, despite the controversy, he sees the decision as "a very positive series of policy changes for bitcoin for sure." Bitcoin\'s price rallied about 6% higher to close out the week after the Fed made its rate decision final Wednesday. Rob Nelson pressed Packham on whether bitcoin’s price would experience a significant jump in the coming weeks. Packham attributed the current range-bound price to election uncertainties. "One candidate is pro-crypto, while the other offers mixed signals. When prediction markets show a strong Kamala Harris lead, bitcoin tends to struggle. A Trump lead, however, often boosts bitcoin’s price," he explained. Despite short-term fluctuations, Packham remains optimistic about bitcoin’s long-term outlook. "Bitcoin has a habit of surprising everyone," he said, adding that historical trends suggest a bullish movement next year, regardless of the election outcome.', 'date': '2024-09-20', 'time': '23:02:10.000', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoins-volatility-intensifies-fed-slashes-230210768.html'}

{'title': 'Google Judge Questions Company Testimony as Ad Defense Begins', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- A senior Google executive sought to refute the US Justice Department’s antitrust case over its display advertising technology business, testifying that it faces “fierce competition” from the likes of Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. Most Read from Bloomberg But the federal judge overseeing the trial in Virginia called the testimony “highly questionable” and potentially “tainted” given that Google officials had known about antitrust concerns over the ad tools since the US opened its probe in 2019. The Justice Department, which accused the Alphabet Inc. unit of monopolizing online ad technology tools, rested its case Friday after two weeks of testimony. That allowed Google to start presenting its defense, calling as the company’s first witness Scott Sheffer, vice president of partnerships. Sheffer, an 18-year veteran of Google, walked through the company’s various products and pointed out dozens of online rivals that provide “fierce competition” in the business. US District Judge Leonie Brinkema, who will decide whether Google violated the law, chastised the company’s lawyers for presenting testimony she viewed as irrelevant. “This doesn’t get to the core issues in this case,” she said, questioning Sheffer’s views on ad tech competition because the company has been aware of antitrust probes for more than four years. A group of state attorneys general filed an antitrust suit over the alleged monopolization in 2020 and the Justice Department filed its own case last year. Sheffer said that Google has recently lost some clients to Microsoft Corp., which purchased AT&T Inc.’s ad tech business in 2022. Also that year, Netflix Inc. moved from Google to Microsoft’s advertising tools, in part, he said, because the Windows maker offered a financial guarantee that was “quite large.” Sheffer also detailed Google’s recent partnerships with X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, and Roku Inc., but Brinkema ruled that the company couldn’t offer the evidence because it had failed to disclose the information to the government earlier in the case. Google is expected to continue its defense next week, after which the Justice Department will have an opportunity to recall witnesses before the trial concludes. The government has alleged that Google manipulates the $677 billion display advertising market in violation of antitrust laws, building up a “trifecta of monopolies” to lock up the technology behind website ads and harm publishers and advertisers — claims Google has denied.

{'title': 'Want Safe Dividend Income in 2024 and Beyond? Invest in These 3 Ultra-High-Yield Stocks.', 'content': 'If your gut tells you now is a good time to add some safe dividend payers to your investment portfolio, you\'d be wise to listen. Between geopolitical turmoil, lingering inflation, unpredictable interest rates, rising loan delinquencies, and political uncertainty, the near future may not be a great environment for some -- or maybe any -- growth stocks. However, these three high-yield dividend stocks are up to the job of providing investors with solid returns, and they should remain so indefinitely. The United States\'   is living on borrowed time. That\'s the top takeaway from the World Health Organization\'s (WHO) most recent look at the matter anyway, which suggests only 18.2% of the nation\'s adult population will be regular tobacco users (smokers, mostly) in 2025. That\'s measurably less than 2000\'s figure of 23.3%. The United States\' tobacco business may actually have more years ahead of it than you might expect, however. Also recognizing the smoking-cessation movement is slowing down, the same WHO report suggests 16.5% of U.S. adults will still be regularly using tobacco by 2030. People are picking up alternative vices like vaping and the use of e-cigarettes in droves in the meantime. The National Center for Health Statistics reports over 4% of the country\'s adults use vape products regularly, offsetting the shrinking number of smokers. Connect the dots. Given the nation\'s expected population growth between now and then (and beyond), there\'s still plenty of opportunity to turn these common consumer habits into lots of cash. The backdrop bodes well for    , parent to Philip Morris USA, which owns familiar U.S. cigarette brands like Marlboro, Virginia Slims, and others. And, even though cigarettes remain its top seller, it also owns vaping brand   and oral nicotine pouch maker Helix Innovations. These other initiatives are softening the impact of tobacco\'s slow demise on Altria, which has adopted the motto "Moving beyond smoking." By accepting the gradual but inevitable decline of the cigarette market rather than resisting it, the company can continue generating good revenue by managing -- and even steering -- the transition to other nicotine products. More important to shareholders, managing this evolution lets Altria continue producing the profits that have supported 55 straight years of annual dividend increases. It\'s important for investors to understand that there won\'t likely be any meaningful or sustainable capital appreciation here. Altria doesn\'t even appear to be trying to muster growth. Its focus is entirely on maintaining the cash flow that funds its dividend payments. With a forward yield of 7.7% and a dividend that could continue growing and being paid for decades though, that\'s not a bad trade-off. Contrary to a common assumption, not all sections of the retail industry are on the ropes. The bulk of the weakness is limited to department stores and the malls where they\'re typically found. Strip malls and neighborhood shopping centers are actually doing pretty well, catering to consumers where and how they like to shop. Enter    . It\'s not a retailer, although its fate is tied to a wide swath of that industry. It\'s a real estate investment trust (REIT), renting brick-and-mortar properties to retailers, sparing its tenants some of the financial commitments of owning all those buildings. That may still seem like a risky proposition on the surface. The landlord is still renting to companies in a retail industry that\'s being pressured by the ongoing growth of e-commerce. This overarching idea ignores a couple of important details though. One is that a great deal of retail consumption is still (for convenience and speed reasons) handled in person at stores. And the other reason? The bulk of Realty Income\'s tenants are among the retailers with the most staying power, like  ,  , 7-Eleven, and even  . Once these chains have established a brick-and-mortar presence in a location, they\'re unlikely to abandon it. That\'s what this REIT\'s dividend track record suggests anyway. Not only has it distributed its monthly (yes, monthly) payments like clockwork ever since they began in 1969, those payouts have been raised 127 times. Those who buy the stock today would be stepping in while Realty Income\'s forward dividend yield stands at 5%. Last but not least, add home appliance maker    to your list of dividend stocks to consider buying while its forward yield stands at 7%. It\'s a suggestion that might raise a few eyebrows. Even if you don\'t know for sure, intuitively, it doesn\'t seem as if there\'d be great demand for home appliances at this time. Growing competition from the likes of  , Bosch, and LG further deflates the bullish argument for owning a stake in this iconic brand name. Things may not be quite as challenging on this front as it seems they should be, though. Unlike some other large purchases, the purchase of a major home appliance can\'t always be put off. Appliances are also more affordable than cars or homes, for example, so getting financing is less of a hurdle. To this end, the Conference Board\'s consumer sentiment measure ticked higher in August specifically because -- in apparent defiance of the economic backdrop -- more U.S. consumers said they intend to purchase a refrigerator, washing machine, or TV within the next six months. It was the fourth straight month these purchasing plans improved. Investors who already know Whirlpool will likely also know that while it has continued to make its dividend payments, it hasn\'t increased them since 2022, when it raised the quarterly payout to $1.75 per share. Keep things in perspective though, its ability to maintain its payout was never in question. The decision to halt its long-established cadence of dividend growth was rooted in an abundance of caution at an extraordinary time in modern history. The COVID-19 pandemic and the ripple effects from it not only temporarily up-ended purchases of appliances, they impeded companies\' ability to manufacture them. This year\'s expected 14% revenue dip and subsequent profit setback should mark the end of these woes though. Analysts forecast that Whirlpool\'s business will turn the corner next year. In the meantime, with the stock trades down 60% from its 2021 high and is valued at less than 9 times next year\'s estimated earnings, the worst-case scenario is already priced in ... and then some.

{'title': 'Stocks Churn in Final Minutes of Friday’s Trading: Markets Wrap', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- US stocks churned in Friday’s final minutes of trading amid expiring derivatives contracts and a big rebalancing. Gold climbed to an all-time high as traders contemplated the central bank’s next move. Most Read from Bloomberg The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both ended the session down 0.2% with the broader benchmark fresh off its 39th record high of 2024. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.1% gain — enough for a closing record. Friday’s quarterly “triple witching” saw about $5.1 trillion derivatives contracts tied to stocks, index options and futures mature, according to an estimate from derivatives analytical firm Asym 500. At the same time another $250 billion in index trades was digested. The options expiry coincides with the rebalancing of benchmark indexes. The event has a reputation for causing sudden price moves as contracts disappear and traders roll over their existing positions or start new ones. FedEx Corp. was among the session’s biggest movers plunging 15% after the economic bellwether missed profit estimates and cautioned that its business would slow. Lennar Corp. slipped after quarterly home orders fell short of Wall Street expectations while Constellation Energy Corp., the biggest US operator of reactors, jumped to a record on plans to put Three Mile Island back into service. Traders picked at the differing views from Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. Waller told CNBC it was favorable inflation data that convinced him to support the Fed’s decision for a half percentage point interest-rate cut this week. Bowman, the lone dissenting voice against the jumbo rate cut, said the move was declaring victory over inflation too early. Confidence has been growing that the central bank will be able to engineer a soft landing, but warnings such as the one from FedEx underscore lingering concerns. Fed policymakers have projected a further half point of reductions this year. “A sustained melt-up in risk is unlikely into peak election uncertainty that may generate a soft patch in the data,” Evercore ISI’s Krishna Guha wrote. “Investors should view the gains in risk post-Fed as a down payment, with a check in the mail for the balance after election day.” Evercore ISI’s vice chairman sees another half-point cut as possible if labor or inflation data come in weak. JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon registered his doubts that the world’s largest economy can straddle slowing growth without tipping into a recession. “I hope it’s true,” he said at an event. “But I’m also more skeptical that inflation is going to go away so easily, not because it hasn’t come down — it has — and it can come down more.” Gold traded above $2,600 an ounce, extending gains after an Israeli strike on a Beirut suburb. Meanwhile, a gauge of dollar strength edged higher while Treasuries were mixed. For Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Hartnett, the optimism in equity markets following the Fed’s move is stoking the risk of a bubble, making bonds and gold an attractive hedge against any recession or renewed inflation. The strategist said stocks are now pricing in more Fed easing and about 18% earnings growth for the S&P 500 by end-2025. It doesn’t “get much better than that for risk, so investors are forced to chase” the rally, Hartnett wrote in a note. He also said stocks outside the US and commodities were a good way to play a possible soft economic landing, with the latter being an inflation hedge. International equities are cheaper and starting to outperform US peers, according to Hartnett. The yen slid after Governor Kazuo Ueda proved less hawkish than some traders expected. Ueda signaled little urgency to hike rates, and said that upside risks to inflation are easing. Investors will get fresh data on PMI, GDP and the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, PCE next week. Some of the main moves in markets: Stocks The S&P 500 fell 0.2% as of 4 p.m. New York time The Nasdaq 100 fell 0.2% The Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed The MSCI World Index fell 0.3% Currencies The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1% The euro was little changed at $1.1161 The British pound rose 0.2% to $1.3316 The Japanese yen fell 0.9% to 143.91 per dollar Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin fell 0.3% to $62,856.63 Ether rose 3.1% to $2,543.12 Bonds The yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced two basis points to 3.73% Germany’s 10-year yield advanced one basis point to 2.21% Britain’s 10-year yield advanced one basis point to 3.90% Commodities West Texas Intermediate crude was little changed Spot gold rose 1.3% to $2,621.47 an ounce This story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation. --With assistance from John Viljoen, Sagarika Jaisinghani and Edward Bolingbroke.

{'title': 'X names Brazil legal representative, its lawyers say', 'content': 'SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Elon Musk-owned social media platform X has named a legal representative in Brazil, the firm\'s lawyers said on Friday, in a move that would address one of the demands imposed by Brazil\'s top court to allow the company to operate in the country. Andre Zonaro and Sergio Rosenthal, who were recently appointed as X\'s lawyers in Brazil, told Reuters that colleague Rachel de Oliveira Conceicao was chosen as the firm\'s legal representative. In late August, Brazil\'s top court ordered mobile and internet service providers to block X in the nation, and users were cut off within hours. The shutdown followed a months-long dispute between Musk and Brazilian Justice Alexandre de Moraes over X\'s non-compliance with court orders demanding the platform take action against the spread of hate speech. Courts have previously blocked accounts implicated in probes of allegedly spreading misinformation and hate, which Musk has denounced as censorship, and had also ordered X to name a local legal representative as required by Brazilian law, after the firm closed its offices in Brazil in mid-August. On Thursday, the lawyers representing X in Brazil said the firm would present a legal representative to the local Supreme Court "very soon." They also said the firm was starting to comply with the orders on removing content, which is another demand from the top court.

This rush, however, has sparked new concerns over the emotional toll of sudden wealth on children – a phenomenon known as “sudden wealth syndrome.” Currently, individuals can transfer up to $13.61 million tax-free to family members, while couples can transfer up to $27.22 million. But this generous tax benefit is set to expire at the end of 2025 and the amount will likely drop by about half. This change prompts ultrawealthy families to act quickly, moving large sums of money to their children before the window closes. Wealthy parents are under pressure to provide money to their children as soon as possible because  . They are concerned that a Democratic president may implement tax laws that would be less advantageous for them. But while they’re focused on protecting their kids’ financial futures, they’re also concerned about how suddenly receiving so much money could impact their children’s well-being. Sudden wealth syndrome is a real challenge for people who suddenly get a lot of money. Children who inherit enormous sums or receive unexpected wealth may experience overwhelming anxiety and uncertainty about what to do with all of their newfound income.  are encouraging families to consider carefully before making these transfers – not just about the tax savings but also about the impact on their children's mental health and future. According to a report, “Much is often made in the media of millennial and Generation Z heirs, but Generation X will be first in line to inherit from their wealthy parent(s).” It also says that over the next 10 years, about 1.2 million people worth $5 million or more will pass down over $31 trillion. Almost two-thirds will come from the ultrarich, those worth $30 million or more. Ultimately, around $20 trillion will be passed down from just 155,000 of the richest individuals.  before they inherit a fortune can help them feel more comfortable managing their wealth. Some families are setting up gradual inheritance plans to ensure their kids won't get all the money at once, while others are seeking professional help to guide their kids through this major life change.

{'title': 'Why big box retailers are experimenting with small-format stores', 'content': 'Target ( ), Ulta Beauty ( ), and Macy’s ( ), among many others, are shifting more of their focus toward small-format stores. Small-format stores are scaled-down versions of big box retail stores that offer consumers an efficient, convenient, and localized shopping experience. According to R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, there are several reasons why retailers are pursuing smaller-format store strategies. “First, smaller-format stores tend to be less expensive to operate than larger-format stores in terms of rent and labor needed to staff the stores,” Hottovy told Yahoo Finance. “Smaller-format stores [help] retailers to streamline operations and focus its merchandise and staff to its best customers. Also, as we\'ve seen many consumers move away from urban areas to more suburban and rural markets, smaller-format stores allow retailers to more efficiently reach these potential customers.” According to  , other reasons for the shift in strategy include the ability “to target a specific demographic, create a personalized shopping experience, or experiment with a new brand direction.” “We expect a continued movement toward smaller-format stores for many retail categories in the future because they tend to be cheaper to operate and allow retailers to access many smaller, high-growth markets,” Hottovy said. “However, some retailers like mass merchants (which have been expanding stores to increase their grocery assortments) and sporting goods (some of which are relying on larger format experiential concepts to drive visits) will continue to evaluate retail formats across a range of store sizes.” Target is one major example of a retailer experimenting with a smaller format. Its average store is around  , and out of its 1,963 stores across the US, over 170 are considered small-format. Those stores are a third of the regular size, under 50,000 square feet. Ulta Beauty, a cosmetics retailer whose partnership with Target includes a small-store concept within the larger retailer, is also seeing success from this business model. The retail beauty giant plans to expand in the US by opening 10 small-format stores, each around 5,000 square feet, in 2024. During Ulta’s fiscal second quarter earnings call in August, Ulta CEO Dave Kimbell told shareholders, “I\'ve shared before in previous calls the work we\'re doing with our small-format store; that\'s performing well. So we\'re going to lean in more there. And so we\'re confident that again, we will work through these competitive pressures, and we want to make sure we\'re reaching as many beauty enthusiasts in all parts of the country as possible with our new stores.” Ulta already has seen traction in its mini "shop-in-shops" in Target locations. “It’s also really key that nearly 4 million guests have linked their Ulta Beauty and their Target circle loyalty programs together,” Ulta COO Kecia Steelman said on the earnings call. “We do see this as another way to just continue to connect with that guest and engage them back into the Ulta Beauty home store.” Earlier this year, Macy’s   it would close 150 underperforming stores, with 50 shuttering by the end of 2024 and the remaining 100 over the next few years. By 2026, the company is expected to have just 350 stores in total. At the same time, Macy’s is standing by its decision to expand its footprint in small-format stores. In 2023, the retailer announced it would open up to 30 more small-format stores throughout 2024, nearly tripling its current count of 15 by 2025. This is a big move for Macy’s, according to Morningstar senior equity analyst Dave Swartz, as it is known for its vast real estate portfolio, including   in New York City. “It’s a move away from traditional shopping malls to strip centers,” Swartz told Yahoo Finance. Like many retailers, Macy\'s is experiencing a slowdown due to a variety of factors, including unrelenting competition, a lack of innovation, a surplus of inventory, and the shift to online shopping. With declining store traffic, there’s less of a need for a 200,000-square-foot store. Plus, the shift toward buying online has taken sales away “permanently,” Swartz said, which is why many small-format stores offer an order online and pick-up in-store option. The shift to smaller-format stores is “risky … but has to be made because the department store model just isn’t working anymore,” he said. —', 'date': '2024-09-20', 'time': '13:28:14.000', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-big-box-retailers-are-experimenting-with-small-format-stores-132814528.html'}

{'title': 'Summers Sees Fed Rate Projections Upended, Higher Mortgage Rates', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said inflation will probably prevent the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates as much as expected in coming years. Most Read from Bloomberg “The risks of actually going as far with monetary policy as the Fed seems to think that it will are pretty significant in terms of having an increase in inflation,” Summers said on Bloomberg Television’s Wall Street Week with David Westin. Fed policymakers, in their new projections for their benchmark rate, have a median estimate of 3.4% for the end of next year — reflecting a potential further 1.5 percentage points of cuts on top of the 50 basis points unveiled Wednesday. Should inflation pressures reemerge, “then you won’t see interest rates go down as much” as officials predicted in their so-called dot plot, said Summers, a Harvard University professor and paid contributor to Bloomberg TV. He cautioned that investors too are overestimating the amount of Fed easing to come. Higher Rates “My suspicion is that there’s some upwards adjustment ahead in longer term rates — perhaps quite significant upwards adjustment in the 10-year rate or the 30-year rate,” he said. Ten-year Treasury yields were at 3.73% as of 4 p.m. in New York, well down from last year’s high above 5%. Higher yields in time would drive up US mortgage rates, Summers noted. A decline in those borrowing costs have only recently started to fuel demand for home loans, offering hope of a rebound in the housing market. “The rates that people are now seeing on mortgages may be relatively low compared to what the average of where they’re going to be over the next five years,” Summers said. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages last week were around 6.15%, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association down from 6.78% at the start of the year. They averaged about 4.2% in the half decade before the pandemic. Summers reiterated his view that the Fed is underestimating the neutral rate, or the long-run rate at which policymakers see their benchmark as consistent with maintaining 2% inflation. Fed officials did boost their estimate in the latest projections on Wednesday, with the median rising to 2.875%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in his press conference that the rate “is probably significantly higher than it was” in the pre-pandemic years when trillions of dollars of government bonds around the world carried negative yields. Powell said “we just don’t know” where neutral will be. “We only know it by its works,” he said, referring to being able to see inflation climb if the Fed’s policy setting is below neutral. Summers said higher fiscal borrowing and major investments in areas including renewable energy and artificial intelligence indicate a higher neutral rate, of at least 4%. Nippon Steel The former Treasury chief separately applauded the apparent move by the Biden administration to postpone a review of Nippon Steel Corp.’s proposed takeover of United States Steel Corp. Bloomberg reported this week that the Japanese company was given permission to refile its plans. “We avoided what would have been a catastrophic act” for both Pennsylvania steelworkers and users of steel including US automakers and the defense industry, Summers said. “My hope would be that in the much less fevered environment that’s likely to exist after the election, cool heads can prevail” and the market allowed to operate, he said.

{'title': 'How platforms like Coinbase are driving bitcoin adoption', 'content': 'The role of self-custody in cryptocurrency and the challenges of mass adoption were at the center of a conversation between Roundtable anchor Rob Nelson, Kelly Kellam, Director of BitLab Academy, and Brian Dixon, CEO of Off The Chain Capital. The discussion explored whether individuals will choose to self-custody their digital assets or rely on institutions and platforms like Coinbase and ETFs for convenience. "I don\'t think most people will self-custody," Rob Nelson stated. "The majority of people in the world aren\'t going to sell custody to their coins." He expressed doubt that the average person would move away from platforms like Coinbase or Gemini in favor of managing their own assets. Kelly Kellam agreed, saying, "I think people still feel like they need a customer service representative to call." He noted that while bitcoin offers more freedom, many users might choose the security and simplicity of letting institutions handle custody instead of taking on that responsibility themselves. Brian Dixon added to the conversation by highlighting the importance of reducing friction for the average investor. "Convenience and removal of friction is what\'s going to attract the fastest adoption," he explained, pointing to Coinbase’s role in simplifying access to bitcoin and the success of ETFs in doing the same for hesitant investors. Looking ahead, Dixon stressed that widespread adoption of bitcoin as a network will depend on user-friendly applications. "No network is valuable unless it has a tremendous amount of users on that network," he said, suggesting that expanding the user base will help prevent institutions from monopolizing bitcoin.', 'date': '2024-09-20', 'time': '22:00:13.000', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/platforms-coinbase-driving-bitcoin-adoption-220013010.html'}

{'title': 'Apple iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro review: Camera control and larger screens, Apple Intelligence not ready yet', 'content': "Apple’s ( ) iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro lineups hit the market on Sept. 20, and they bring a handful of updates that, if you’re using an older iPhone, make them worth the upgrade. There’s a new camera button, improved camera performance, bigger screens on the Pro models, and better battery life all around. I’ve spent some time using both the iPhone 16, starting at $799, and the iPhone 16 Pro, starting at $999. If you’re coming from an outdated iPhone, you’ll appreciate the new phones’ refinements. But the biggest upgrade to Apple’s newest iPhones is  . Available as a software update in October — no, it’s not launching alongside the phones — Apple Intelligence will bring a series of AI-powered features to the iPhone including a smarter Siri, AI-based writing tools for summarizing and rewriting your messages to fit a specific tone, and the option to summarize your notifications so you don’t have to read through 57 unrelated texts to find out what time you and your friends are getting dinner tonight. To use Apple Intelligence, however, you’ll need to have either an iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, or iPhone 16 Pro. If you’ve got an iPhone 15, you’re out of luck. Apple says the base 15 simply isn’t powerful enough to run the Apple Intelligence software. Apple is positioning Apple Intelligence as its next revolutionary product. And while it’s too early to say whether that’s true or not, after using a beta version of the software, I can say its new capabilities are certainly welcome additions to the iPhone. I can’t say Apple Intelligence is the kind of thing that’s worth upgrading your iPhone for just yet, but taken as a whole, the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro lines provide the right kind of improvements that make them solid updates. Let’s talk about what’s new to the iPhone 16 lineup. First is the new Camera Control button. A new way to launch and, well, control the camera, the Camera Control button is found on the lower right side of both iPhone 16s and iPhone 16 Pros. Press the button and you’ll instantly launch the iPhone’s Camera app. Gently double-press the button and it’ll pull up the app’s camera exposure, depth, zoom, cameras, styles, and tone options. Lightly tap the button again to dive deeper into each setting. Sure, you can already launch the camera app by swiping right or tapping the camera button from the iPhone’s lock screen, but Camera Control makes it feel like you’re using an old-school point-and-shoot camera. Man, referring to it like that makes me feel old. Still, it’s true. Being able to take photos and shoot videos by pressing or pressing and holding the Camera Control button does make capturing your subjects as easy as using an old, dedicated camera. You don’t have to move your finger around the screen to change the zoom level or adjust the exposure, losing your framing and risking dropping your iPhone. Is it the sole reason to upgrade? No, but it’s a helpful addition to the iPhone. On the camera front, Apple’s new styles feature allows you to adjust the look of your shot from stark black and white to luminous, adjusting various sections of the photo rather than simply blanketing it with a filter. The result is a camera option that genuinely makes your shots look far more interesting and lively than they otherwise would. It’s an excellent enhancement to the camera app, and one you’ll want to try out as soon as you get the chance. Apple has also added a new Audio Mix editing mode for your videos that is meant to improve the voice of the person in your shot versus the ambient sound around you. There’s a standard mode that leaves all of the audio levels the same, an in-frame option that focuses more on the subject in the shot and reduces the background levels, as well as studio and cinematic modes. It’s downright impressive how much of a difference the modes make to your video, and swapping between each while editing your piece lets you see which is better for your project. If you’re in a crowded place and want to get a video of your friends and family, the in-frame mode is the choice for you. And because you adjust the audio style while editing rather than while shooting your video, you don’t have to worry that you recorded it in the wrong mode and risk ruining your video when you take it. All four iPhones also get new cameras. The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus now feature 48-megapixel ultra-wide cameras that can capture macro photography images and provide better low-light shots. Apple also says the phones offer the equivalent of a 2x optical zoom thanks to their 48-megapixel Fusion cameras. The iPhone 16 Pro now comes with a 5x telephoto camera to make the 5x camera on the Pro Max, and both Pro phones get new 48-megapixel Fusion cameras and 48-megapixel ultra-wide cameras. All of that works out to some incremental changes for the iPhones' cameras. Overall, the ability to take macro photos using the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus and the addition of 5x telephoto zoom to the iPhone 16 Pro are the best upgrades of the lot. In the future, Apple will also add a feature called visual intelligence to the iPhone that will allow users to point their phones' cameras at real-world objects and get information on them. One example Apple has offered is snapping a shot of a restaurant and quickly getting its hours and user reviews. But that won’t land until later this year. In addition to updated cameras, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max get new larger displays. The iPhone 16 Pro’s screen goes from 6.1 inches to 6.3 inches, while the Pro Max’s goes from 6.7 to 6.9 inches. Apple did this by slightly increasing the size of the phones and slimming down their bezels, making them look more like a single piece of glass up front. It’s not an enormous increase in screen size, but when you’re streaming movies or scrolling Reddit, any extra space is an improvement. Apple’s always-on display also makes a comeback on the Pro and Pro Max, but it’s still not available on the 16 or 16 Plus, which is a bummer. Apple did, however, bring the Action Button over to the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. Previously only available on the Pros, the Action Button is a customizable button on the left side of the iPhone that you can set to do things like launch the voice recorder, magnifier, or, my favorite, the flashlight. In terms of power, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus get Apple’s new A18 chip, while the Pro and Pro Max get the A18 Pro processor. You won’t run into any slowdown with either chip whether you’re playing games or just browsing TikTok or Instagram, and they’re both designed to run Apple Intelligence. As for battery life, I got through my entire work day with the iPhone 16, then streamed the Mets game, and the battery still had a 19% charge at about 10:30 at night. As for the Pro, I used it for email and Slack, perusing social media apps, and ordering from Dunkin, and still had 71% battery life after about 7 hours of use. The latest iPhones bring speedier chips, larger displays on the Pros, improved cameras, and a new camera button. If, however, you just bought an iPhone 15 or 15 Pro or even have an iPhone 14, you can still hold off. I can’t say whether Apple Intelligence is worth upgrading to a new phone because it’s not ready for prime time yet. And since it’s still in beta, Apple could change or add or remove features before it releases the software. All other things considered, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro are what you’d expect from Apple. Great phones that are incrementally better than their predecessors. We’ll have to wait until Apple Intelligence comes out to know if it pushes the phones beyond that.", 'date': '2024-09-20', 'time': '14:18:08.000', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-iphone-16-and-iphone-16-pro-review-camera-control-and-larger-screens-apple-intelligence-not-ready-yet-141808714.html'}

{'title': 'Q2 Earnings Recap: Proto Labs (NYSE:PRLB) Tops Custom Parts Manufacturing Stocks', 'content': 'As the craze of earnings season draws to a close, here’s a look back at some of the most exciting (and some less so) results from Q2. Today, we are looking at custom parts manufacturing stocks, starting with Proto Labs (NYSE:PRLB). Onshoring and inventory management–themes that grew in focus after COVID wreaked havoc on global supply chains–are tailwinds for companies that combine economies of scale with reliable service. Many in the space have adopted 3D printing to efficiently address the need for bespoke parts and components, but all companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. For example, consumer spending and interest rates can greatly impact the industrial production that drives demand for these companies’ offerings. The 4 custom parts manufacturing stocks we track reported a softer Q2. As a group, revenues missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 5.1% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 6.7% below. Inflation progressed towards the Fed\'s 2% goal recently, leading the Fed to reduce its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent or 0.5%) in September 2024. This is the first cut in four years. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be debating whether this rate cut\'s timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. Amidst this news, custom parts manufacturing stocks have had a rough stretch. On average, share prices are down 11.3% since the latest earnings results. Pioneering the concept of online quoting and manufacturing for custom prototypes and low-volume production parts, Proto Labs (NYSE:PRLB) offers injection molding, 3D printing, and sheet metal fabrication for manufacturers in various industries. Proto Labs reported revenues of $125.6 million, up 2.8% year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations, but overall, it was a decent quarter for the company with strong earnings guidance for the next quarter. "We executed well through the first half of 2024 despite operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment,” said Rob Bodor, President and Chief Executive Officer. Proto Labs pulled off the fastest revenue growth of the whole group. Even though it had a great quarter relative to its peers, the market seems discontent with the results. The stock is down 27.8% since reporting and currently trades at $1.95. . Beginning as a start-up at SolidWorks World–an annual design and engineering conference, Markforged (NYSE:MKFG) offers 3D printers and softwares to manufacturers of various industries. Markforged reported revenues of $21.69 million, down 14.8% year on year, in line with analysts’ expectations. It was unfortunately a slower quarter with full-year revenue guidance missing analysts’ expectations. Markforged pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat and highest full-year guidance raise among its peers. Although it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 27.8% since reporting. It currently trades at $1.95. Is now the time to buy Markforged?  . Originating from a research lab at MIT, Desktop Metal (NYSE:DM) offers 3D printers, production materials, and software to many industries. Desktop Metal reported revenues of $38.93 million, down 26.9% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 14.4%. It was a disappointing quarter as it posted a miss of analysts’ earnings estimates. Desktop Metal delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group. As expected, the stock is down 4.5% since the results and currently trades at $4.69. Born from the Founder’s idea of making a toy frog with a glue gun, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) offers 3D printers and related materials, software, and services to many industries. Stratasys reported revenues of $138 million, down 13.6% year on year. This number came in 5.7% below analysts\' expectations. Overall, it was a disappointing quarter as it also recorded full-year revenue guidance missing analysts’ expectations and underwhelming earnings guidance for the full year. Stratasys had the weakest full-year guidance update among its peers. The stock is down 2.5% since reporting and currently trades at $7.49.

{'title': 'A Look Back at Casino Operator Stocks’ Q2 Earnings: Red Rock Resorts (NASDAQ:RRR) Vs The Rest Of The Pack', 'content': "Wrapping up Q2 earnings, we look at the numbers and key takeaways for the casino operator stocks, including Red Rock Resorts (NASDAQ:RRR) and its peers. Casino operators enjoy limited competition because gambling is a highly regulated industry. These companies can also enjoy healthy margins and profits. Have you ever heard the phrase ‘the house always wins’? Regulation cuts both ways, however, and casinos may face stroke-of-the-pen risk that suddenly limits what they can or can't do and where they can do it. Furthermore, digitization is changing the game, pun intended. Whether it’s online poker or sports betting on your smartphone, innovation is forcing these players to adapt to changing consumer preferences, such as being able to wager anywhere on demand. The 9 casino operator stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.6%. The Fed cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024, the first in roughly four years. This marks the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. Thankfully, casino operator stocks have been resilient with share prices up 5.1% on average since the latest earnings results. Founded in 1976, Red Rock Resorts (NASDAQ:RRR) operates a range of casino resorts and entertainment properties, primarily in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Red Rock Resorts reported revenues of $486.4 million, up 16.9% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 2.2%. Despite the top-line beat, it was still a slower quarter for the company with a miss of analysts’ earnings estimates. Red Rock Resorts pulled off the fastest revenue growth of the whole group. Even though it had a great quarter relative to its peers, the market seems discontent with the results. The stock is down 12.6% since reporting and currently trades at $37.56. . Operating several properties on the Las Vegas Strip, MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) is a global hospitality and entertainment company known for its resorts and casinos. MGM Resorts reported revenues of $4.33 billion, up 9.8% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 2.9%. The business had a very strong quarter with an impressive beat of analysts’ earnings estimates and a decent beat of analysts’ Hotel revenue estimates. Although it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 12.6% since reporting. It currently trades at $37.56. Is now the time to buy MGM Resorts?  . Founded in 2001, Golden Entertainment (NASDAQ:GDEN) is a gaming company operating casinos, taverns, and distributed gaming platforms. Golden Entertainment reported revenues of $167.3 million, down 41.6% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 2.9%. It was a disappointing quarter as it posted a miss of analysts’ earnings estimates. Golden Entertainment delivered the slowest revenue growth in the group. Interestingly, the stock is up 16.5% since the results and currently trades at $32.79. Founded by the former Mirage Resorts CEO, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) is a global developer and operator of high-end hotels and casinos, known for its luxurious properties and premium guest services. Wynn Resorts reported revenues of $1.73 billion, up 8.6% year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations. Aside from that, it was a slower quarter as it produced a miss of analysts’ earnings estimates. The stock is up 5.1% since reporting and currently trades at $80.18. Formerly Eldorado Resorts, Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) is a global gaming and hospitality company operating numerous casinos, hotels, and resort properties. Caesars Entertainment reported revenues of $2.83 billion, down 1.7% year on year. This number missed analysts’ expectations by 1%.

{'title': 'Goldman’s Global Head of Trading Becomes Chief Strategy Officer', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Josh Schiffrin, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’ global head of trading strategy, was promoted to chief strategy officer and head of financial risk for global banking and markets at the firm, according to a memo seen by Bloomberg. Most Read from Bloomberg The new role is an extension of his current responsibilities, which will now include overseeing the financial risk team, FICC desk and prime risk strats team — where he will provide risk analysis for Goldman’s prime brokerage clients — and the strategy, investments and partnerships team. “In addition, Josh will partner with our businesses to ensure we have diligent supervision of our trading activities and a strong control environment,” Ashok Varadhan and Dan Dees, Goldman’s co-heads of global banking and markets, wrote in a memo dated Sept. 17. Schiffrin joined Goldman in 2001 as an analyst, and was named managing director in 2009 and partner in 2012. In November 2023 he became the global head of trading strategy. His recent call on the size of Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut proved to be correct and he’s not ruling out two more 50 basis cuts. “The employment data will lead the path of policy. The path of 50/50/50 is possible if labor remains weak and unemployment rate ticks up,” Schiffrin said on a client webinar ahead of the Fed’s rate decision on Sept. 18.

{'title': 'FedEx stock plummets after earnings miss, lower outlook flashes warning on economy', 'content': 'FedEx stock ( ) tanked nearly 15% Friday morning following a   the day before, highlighting investor concerns over emerging cracks in the US economy. FedEx, which is often viewed as a bellwether for the economy, reported profits of $892 million, about 24% lower than analysts anticipated for its fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 31. The company also lowered its financial outlook for the fiscal year ahead, projecting earnings per share between $20 and $21 versus its prior range of $20 to $22. The quarterly results came a day after the Federal Reserve made a historically large reduction to interest rates but said the US economy remained strong. FedEx\'s outlook runs in contrast to that read. “The magnitude of the Fed rate cuts yesterday signals the weakness of the current environment,” FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam told analysts in a call Thursday afternoon. Investors seemed to sway toward Subramaniam’s reading of the rate cuts Friday morning, or, at the very least, their initial euphoria faded. After reaching record highs the day before, the S&P 500 ( ) sank 0.43%. The Dow ( ) fell 0.38%, and the Nasdaq (  dropped 0.44%. FedEx executives attributed the company\'s poor performance to inflation-squeezed customers shifting away from paying higher fees for its priority shipping. Subramaniam also blamed a “weaker industrial economy” for waning demand for its B2B services, or shipments between businesses and manufacturers. And FedEx is ending its contract with the US Postal Service. Subramaniam said the company expects to take a $500 million hit from the partnership’s termination. Subramaniam said the company will continue aggressive cost-cutting efforts, which are expected to save the company $4 billion in the next fiscal year. Stephens analyst Daniel Imbro offered some hope for FedEx’s future in an interview with Yahoo Finance Friday morning. “We have been recommending buying it here in the $250s, as we think the next 12 months offers a pretty attractive risk-reward from these levels,” Imbro said. But Oppenheimer analysts said they’re taking a wait-and-see approach to FedEx’s cost reduction efforts. “With the company integrating its Express and Ground segments into one via its Network 2.0 initiative, we await demonstrated sustained progression toward total company past peak margin levels in a still challenging operating environment," they wrote in a note to investors Friday morning.', 'date': '2024-09-20', 'time': '15:04:44.000', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-stock-plummets-after-earnings-miss-lower-outlook-flashes-warning-on-economy-150444995.html'}

The election, contested by 38 candidates, is largely a three-way race among  , Marxist-leaning  , and  . There are  , and final results are expected Sunday. The results will show whether Sri Lankans approve of Wickremesinghe's leadership over the country's fragile recovery, including restructuring its debt under an International Monetary Fund program after it defaulted in 2022. The government announced Thursday that it passed the final hurdle in   in principle with private bond holders. Sri Lanka’s local and foreign debt totaled $83 billion at the time it defaulted, and the government says it has now restructured more than $17 billion. Despite a significant improvement in key economic figures, Sri Lankans are struggling under high taxes and living costs. Both Premadasa and Dissanayake say they will renegotiate the IMF deal to make austerity measures more bearable. Wickremesinghe has warned that any move to alter the basics of the agreement could delay the release of a fourth tranche of nearly $3 billion in assistance pledged by the IMF that's crucial to maintaining stability. Sri Lanka’s economic crisis resulted largely from excessive borrowing on projects that did not generate revenue. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government’s insistence on using scarce foreign reserves to prop up the currency, the rupee, contributed to the economy’s free fall. The economic collapse brought a  , food, cooking gas and fuel, with people spending days waiting in line to obtain them. It led to rioting in which protesters took over key buildings including the president’s house, his office and the prime minister’s office, forcing then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign. Wickremesinghe was elected by a parliamentary vote in July 2022 to cover the remainder of Rajapaksa’s five-year term. Now, Wickremesinghe is seeking another term to strengthen the gains. However, many people accuse him of protecting  , whom they blame for the economic crisis.

{'title': 'Most People Expect To Retire at 67, But 56% Retire Sooner – Can You Guess the Actual Average Retirement Age?', 'content': "Many plan to work well into their 60s or even 70s, thinking they can compensate for years of undersaving. But according to recent surveys, retirement may come earlier than expected for many Americans – whether they're  The average retirement age in the U.S. is about 62 years old, even though most workers expect to retire around 67. In fact, more than 56% of retirees left the workforce earlier than they planned, according to a Transamerica survey. So, what's causing this  ? Health is a big factor. Roughly 38% of early retirees say they had to stop working because of health issues or disabilities. This isn't always part of the plan, but sudden medical conditions or ongoing health problems can change things quickly. This is a reality many don't account for when imagining working into their late 60s or 70s. Then there's the job market itself. Fourteen percent of those who retired early did so after being laid off; for many, finding another job isn't appealing or feasible. Companies downsize, industries change and job security becomes less certain as people age, making retirement sometimes  . In addition to these reasons, life events – like family changes or unexpected financial shifts – can also force people to reconsider their plans. Some may find they've saved enough to retire early, but for most, it's often a mix of circumstance and necessity that leads them there. Financially, retiring earlier than planned can be a challenge. Many people end up dipping into their savings sooner than expected, which stretches their retirement funds thinner over a longer period. According to various reports, the average American retiree has around $269,078 saved for retirement, far below what's typically recommended. Financial planners suggest a target of around $572,000 and that gap can mean tough choices down the road. Additionally, if people claim Social Security benefits before they hit their full retirement age – 67 for many – they'll see a permanent reduction in monthly benefits. Plus, if they retire before Medicare eligibility kicks in at 65, they may   or gaps in coverage. So, what does this all mean? Planning to work longer might not be the foolproof strategy some hope it will be. Between health issues, layoffs and other unexpected life events, early retirement happens to more people than you might think. And without enough savings, the   can get complicated fast. While everyone's situation is different, having a backup plan and saving more now might be the safest bet for those who want more control when they retire. It's always smart to reassess your retirement plan and   can give you a clearer picture of where you stand. They can help you adjust your savings strategy, review your investment options and ensure you're prepared for any surprises that could force early retirement.

{'title': 'Unpacking Q2 Earnings: Sealed Air (NYSE:SEE) In The Context Of Other Industrial Packaging Stocks', 'content': 'As the craze of earnings season draws to a close, here’s a look back at some of the most exciting (and some less so) results from Q2. Today, we are looking at industrial packaging stocks, starting with Sealed Air (NYSE:SEE). Industrial packaging companies have built competitive advantages from economies of scale that lead to advantaged purchasing and capital investments that are difficult and expensive to replicate. Recently, eco-friendly packaging and conservation are driving customers preferences and innovation. For example, plastic is not as desirable a material as it once was. Despite being integral to consumer goods ranging from beer to toothpaste to laundry detergent, these companies are still at the whim of the macro, especially consumer health and consumer willingness to spend. The 9 industrial packaging stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q2. As a group, revenues missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.7% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 2.3% below. Big picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank\'s 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they\'re too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled. Thankfully, industrial packaging stocks have been resilient with share prices up 7.5% on average since the latest earnings results. Founded in 1960, Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE: SEE) specializes in the development and production of protective and food packaging solutions, serving a variety of industries. Sealed Air reported revenues of $1.35 billion, down 2.6% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 2.9%. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ operating margin and volume estimates. "Our second quarter results were ahead of our expectations, reflecting strong sequential demand within our Food business, accelerated benefits from our CTO2Grow program that more than offset the continued pressure within our Protective business," said Patrick Kivits, Sealed Air\'s CEO. Sealed Air pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat of the whole group. Unsurprisingly, the stock is up 3.5% since reporting and currently trades at $35.60. Is now the time to buy Sealed Air?  . Founded as Kum Kleen Products, Avery Dennison (NYSE:AVY) is a manufacturer of adhesive materials, display graphics, and packaging products, serving various industries. Avery Dennison reported revenues of $2.24 billion, up 6.9% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 1.9%. The business had a very strong quarter with an impressive beat of analysts’ organic revenue and operating margin estimates. Avery Dennison achieved the fastest revenue growth among its peers. Although it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 6.7% since reporting. It currently trades at $209.36. Is now the time to buy Avery Dennison?  . Established in 1987, Silgan Holdings (NYSE:SLGN) is a supplier of rigid packaging for consumer goods products, specializing in metal containers, closures, and plastic packaging. Silgan Holdings reported revenues of $1.38 billion, down 3.2% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 3.4%. It was a softer quarter as it posted a miss of analysts’ organic revenue estimates. Interestingly, the stock is up 5.6% since the results and currently trades at $51.45. Founded in 1991, Graphic Packaging (NYSE:GPK) is a provider of paper-based packaging solutions for a wide range of products. Graphic Packaging Holding reported revenues of $2.24 billion, down 6.5% year on year. This number lagged analysts\' expectations by 1.3%. All in all, it was a mixed quarter for the company. The stock is up 6.6% since reporting and currently trades at $29.86. Founded as Imperial Plastics, Berry Global (NYSE: BERY) is a manufacturer and marketer of plastic packaging products, including containers, bottles, and prescription packaging. Berry Global Group reported revenues of $3.16 billion, down 2.1% year on year. This number came in 2.9% below analysts\' expectations. It was a slower quarter as it also recorded a miss of analysts’ organic revenue estimates. The stock is up 2.9% since reporting and currently trades at $67.54.

{'title': "Trump keeps hammering Fed over rate cut: 'It was a political move'", 'content': 'Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is not letting up in   following a jumbo-sized half-percentage-point interest rate cut made less than two months before the November election. "It really is a political move," the former president said Thursday during an interview with Newsmax. "Most people thought it was going to be half of that number, which probably would have been the right thing to do," Trump added. "So it’s a political move to try and keep somebody in office, but it’s not going to work because the inflation has been so bad." The remarks were the second time in two days that Trump argued the central bank may have played politics in an attempt to help the current Democratic administration, which includes his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris. On Wednesday he also made an additional point that the bigger cut was also a sign of a weak economy that he claims was brought on by the same Biden-Harris administration. "I guess it shows the economy is very bad to cut it by that much assuming that they are not just playing politics," Trump  . Powell — who in 2018 was elevated to Fed chair by then-President Trump but has found himself often at odds with him in recent years — on Wednesday rejected the idea that the Fed had any political considerations in initiating its first rate cut since 2020. "This is my fourth presidential election at the Fed, and it\'s always the same," Powell said. "We\'re always going into this meeting in particular and asking, \'What\'s the right thing to do for the people we serve?\'" "We don\'t put up any other filters," he added. He also rejected the idea that the cut happened because of a weak economy. "Our economy is strong overall," Powell told reporters, arguing the move to cut the Fed\'s benchmark rate by 50 basis points was instead a way to try to ensure "strength in the labor market can be maintained" alongside economic growth. Democrats have also tried to seize the political advantage in the days since the rate cut was announced, with some even putting their own pressure on Powell. Some on the left, in fact, made the point that the Fed chair waited too long to cut. “This cut in interest rates is yet another acknowledgement that Powell waited too long to reduce rates,”   Sen. Elizabeth Warren after the news, but she added that she was happy that lower rates are now in place. Warren, who previously advocated for a 75 basis point cut, added Wednesday that “more rate cuts are needed.” President Biden on Thursday said the move was “a signal we’ve entered a new phase of our economy and our recovery.” Harris added in her own statement the move is "welcome news for Americans who have borne the brunt of high prices [but] my focus is on the work ahead to keep bringing prices down." Trump has been the loudest critic of the Fed all year long while on the campaign trail. He   that cuts are something "they know they shouldn\'t be doing." That came after a February  , where Trump said of cuts, "I think [Powell\'s] going to do something to probably help the Democrats." Then he raised eyebrows   when he offered that the president should "have a say" in Fed decisions and that Powell has "gotten it wrong a lot." Trump\'s new critique is one he telegraphed this week before the Fed acted. "They\'ll do the rate cut and all the political stuff," Trump   before the news came in about the widely expected cut. The underlying reason, he added, "is because the economy is not good, otherwise you wouldn\'t be able to do it."', 'date': '2024-09-20', 'time': '14:36:46.000', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-keeps-hammering-fed-over-rate-cut-it-was-a-political-move-143645110.html'}

{'title': 'Sumitomo Hires Juan Toro as CEO of Its Mexican Non-Bank Lender', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. hired Juan Toro as managing director and chief executive officer for its Mexican non-bank financial company. Most Read from Bloomberg Toro will partner with managing director and country head Alfredo Santillan and focus on expanding Sumitomo’s corporate internet-banking platform in Mexico, Carl Adams, SMBC America’s head of structured debt, wrote in a memo seen by Bloomberg News. Toro was most recently at Atlantico Capital, and before that was a managing director at infrastructure project-finance advisory Astris Finance. Sumitomo launched its Mexican sofom, a type of non-bank financial institution, in 2015 to focus on corporate and project finance following the expansion of Japanese car manufacturers and equipment suppliers in Latin America’s second-biggest economy. SMBC was a bookrunner on Mexico’s sale last week of a $1.5 billion bond to pay off its purchase of power plants from Spain’s Iberdrola SA.

{'title': 'FedEx earnings miss could signal a slowing economy', 'content': 'FedEx said a weaker industrial economy produced a “challenging” quarter that caused it to trim its outlook for later this year, a sign of possible cooling in the wider economy. The company, sometimes seen as a bellwether for the US and global economies by investors, focused most of its concerns on industrial customers who ship goods to other businesses, not on consumers who make up the overwhelming majority of US economic activity. In fact CEO Rajesh Subramaniam said the company is seeing e-commerce shipments “start to grow again.” But the industrial customers are the source of worry for FedEx, and for investors, who sent shares of FedEx ( ) down 14% on Friday. “The soft industrial economy is clearly weighing on the (business-to-business) volumes, and it was definitely much weaker than we expected and we have to make adjustments accordingly,” Subramaniam told investors in a call Thursday following its late-day report. “And as you know, shipments linked to industrial production are our highest-yielding and the most profitable.” The company said that led to “reduced demand for priority services (and) increased demand for deferred services.” FedEx is a company created and built on the need of people to get packages moved fast — it’s in the name, after all. When people stop doing that in the interest of saving money, it’s bad news for the company. FedEx experienced “pretty dramatic changes” in the shift in the mix from priority to deferred, according to CFO John Dietrich in the investors call, even though he said the total volumes “were, for the most part, pretty strong.” The weaker-than-expected results came the day after the Federal Reserve made a bigger-than-expected interest rate cut   in an effort to spur US economic activity. Subramaniam cited that cut in his remarks to analysts. “The magnitude of the Fed rate cuts yesterday signals the weakness of the current environment,” he said. “Now, we’re not assuming a significant comeback on the industrial environment in the rest of this (calendar year).” Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday, however, said the Fed was cutting interest rates to support the labor market. “The labor market is in solid condition, and our intention with our policy move today is to keep it there,” Powell said. “You can say that about the whole economy: The US economy is in good shape. It’s growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down. The labor market is at a strong pace. We want to keep it there. That’s what we’re doing.” Subramaniam said FedEx is “cautiously optimistic” that industrial production will moderately improve in early 2025, “but we are dialing in pretty low growth expectations at this point because of the environment we are seeing.” Among other issues FedEx dealt with were increased costs, particularly for wages. Shares of FedEx had been up 21% year-to-date through Thursday’s close before Friday’s decline.
