{'title': "Oil prices extend gains as markets wait for Israel's retaliation against Iran", 'content': 'Oil extended its gains on Monday following its biggest weekly gain in more than a year in anticipation of an Israeli retaliation against Iran  . Separately, Hurricane Milton headed towards Florida off the gulf of Mexico strengthened to Category 5, also helping fuel higher crude prices. West Texas Intermediate ( ) advanced more than 3% to close at $77.14 per barrel after gaining more than 9% last week. Brent ( ), the international benchmark price, also advanced more than 3.5% to settle at $80.93. Tel Aviv has vowed to strike back after Iran launched some 200 ballistic missiles toward Israel last Tuesday. Oil futures have been moving on speculation of whether that retaliation will include targeting Iran\'s oil infrastructure. "The Iranian military has responded by saying any attack from Israel would trigger yet a stronger response from Iran, so the geopolitical stages effect on crude continues to grow," Dennis Kissler, BOK Financial\'s senior vice president of trading, wrote on Monday. During Friday’s session, oil  Israel from targeting Iran’s oil fields. The remarks came a day after crude jumped more than 5% after the president seemed to suggest that the US was discussing such a possibility with Israel. Iran produces more than three million barrels of oil a day. Interrupting supply would send prices higher while cutting off shipments on the Straight of Hormuz, a chokepoint for crude shipments, would cause even more upward pressure, according to analysts. "If there\'s a stranglehold there, and there\'s a serious blockage or serious delays, we should clear $80 [for Brent]. That is going to push oil prices significantly higher. That is a game changer," Blue Line Futures founder Bill Baruch told Yahoo Finance last week. However, analysts point to spare capacity expected to come onto the market from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The oil alliance has indicated it will start unwinding voluntary production cuts in December. Under two hypothetical scenarios where Iran\'s oil supply is interrupted by either 2 million or 1 million barrels per day, Goldman Sachs sees Brent reaching a peak of $90 or the mid-$80s, respectively, provided that OPEC rapidly offsets the shortfall. The firm predicts in the absence of major disruptions to oil supply in the Middle East, Brent will continue to trade in the $70-$85 range, with an average price of $77 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2024. The possibility of interruptions from Hurricane Milton in the gulf of Mexico has also kept crude markets uneasy. Chevron ( )   it evacuated all personnel from its Blind Faith platform in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and shut-in the facility in preparation for Milton. Although Florida’s west coast could see the worst winds and rain from Milton since 2017, the inclement weather is expected to miss "most oil and gas production platforms," said Bok Financial\'s Kissler.', 'date': '2024-10-07', 'time': '20:19:52.000', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-extend-gains-as-markets-wait-for-israels-retaliation-against-iran-154717391.html'}

{'title': 'Firing on All Cylinders: MRC Global (NYSE:MRC) Q2 Earnings Lead the Way', 'content': "Looking back on infrastructure distributors stocks’ Q2 earnings, we examine this quarter’s best and worst performers, including MRC Global (NYSE:MRC) and its peers. Focusing on narrow product categories that can lead to economies of scale, infrastructure distributors sell essential goods that often enjoy more predictable revenue streams. For example, the ongoing inspection, maintenance, and replacement of pipes and water pumps are critical to a functioning society, rendering them non-discretionary. Lately, innovation to address trends like water conservation has driven incremental sales. But like the broader industrials sector, infrastructure distributors are also at the whim of economic cycles as external factors like interest rates can greatly impact commercial and residential construction projects that drive demand for infrastructure products. The 4 infrastructure distributors stocks we track reported a slower Q2. As a group, revenues missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.7%. Big picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled. Amidst this news, infrastructure distributors stocks have had a rough stretch. On average, share prices are down 6.1% since the latest earnings results. Producing bomb casings and tracks for vehicles during WWII, MRC (NYSE:MRC) offers pipes, valves, and fitting products for various industries. MRC Global reported revenues of $832 million, down 4.5% year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations, and overall, it was a very strong quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ operating margin and earnings estimates. Rob Saltiel, MRC Global’s President and CEO stated, “We achieved sequential growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and cash flow from operations in the second quarter, despite slowing activity in the US oilfield and project delays in our DIET sector. We have generated $101 million in operating cash flow through the first half of 2024, and we are tracking well to meet or exceed our annual operating cash flow target of $200 million. MRC Global achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat but had the slowest revenue growth of the whole group. Investor expectations, however, were likely higher than Wall Street’s published projections, leaving some wishing for even better results (analysts’ consensus estimates are those published by big banks and advisory firms, not the investors who make buy and sell decisions). The stock is down 2.1% since reporting and currently trades at $12.89. Is now the time to buy MRC Global?  . Spun off from National Oilwell Varco, NOW Inc. (NYSE:DNOW) provides distribution and supply chain solutions for the energy and industrial end markets. NOW reported revenues of $633 million, up 6.6% year on year, in line with analysts’ expectations. The business had a strong quarter with an impressive beat of analysts’ operating margin estimates and a decent beat of analysts’ earnings estimates. Although it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 9.8% since reporting. It currently trades at $12.67. Is now the time to buy NOW?  . Formerly a division of industrial distributor HD Supply, Core & Main (NYSE:CNM) is a provider of water, wastewater, and fire protection products and services. Core & Main reported revenues of $1.96 billion, up 5.5% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 4.5%. It was a disappointing quarter as it posted a miss of analysts’ earnings estimates. Core & Main delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates in the group. As expected, the stock is down 8.1% since the results and currently trades at $43.03. Originally a manufacturing company, Watsco (NYSE:WSO) today only distributes air conditioning, heating, and refrigeration equipment, as well as related parts and supplies. Watsco reported revenues of $2.14 billion, up 6.8% year on year. This number came in 2.1% below analysts' expectations. It was a disappointing quarter as it also recorded a miss of analysts’ same-store sales and earnings estimates. Watsco achieved the fastest revenue growth among its peers. The stock is down 4.6% since reporting and currently trades at $480.69. Help us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.

{'title': 'Q2 Earnings Highlights: Wayfair (NYSE:W) Vs The Rest Of The Online Retail Stocks', 'content': 'Let’s dig into the relative performance of Wayfair (NYSE:W) and its peers as we unravel the now-completed Q2 online retail earnings season. Consumers ever rising demand for convenience, selection, and speed are secular engines underpinning ecommerce adoption. For years prior to Covid, ecommerce penetration as a percentage of overall retail would grow 1-2% annually, but in 2020 adoption accelerated by 5%, reaching 25%, as increased emphasis on convenience drove consumers to structurally buy more online. The surge in buying caused many online retailers to rapidly grow their logistics infrastructures, preparing them for further growth in the years ahead as consumer shopping habits continue to shift online. The 6 online retail stocks we track reported a slower Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.6% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 1.3% below. Big picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank\'s 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they\'re too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled. Luckily, online retail stocks have performed well with share prices up 18% on average since the latest earnings results. Launched in 2002 by founder Niraj Shah, Wayfair (NYSE: W) is a leading online retailer for mass market home goods in the US, UK, Canada, and Germany. Wayfair reported revenues of $3.12 billion, down 1.7% year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 2%. Overall, it was a disappointing quarter for the company with a miss of analysts’ buyer estimates and slow revenue growth. "Q2 was a dynamic quarter that resulted in another period of share gain, amid continued macro headwinds that are pressuring the ways customers are shopping the category. Customers remain cautious in their spending on the home, and our credit card data suggests that the category correction now mirrors the magnitude of the peak to trough decline the home furnishing space experienced during the great financial crisis," said Niraj Shah, CEO, co-founder and co-chairman, Wayfair. Wayfair delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth of the whole group. The company reported 22 million active buyers, up 0.9% year on year. Interestingly, the stock is up 2.2% since reporting and currently trades at $55.60. . Known for its glass tower car vending machines, Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) provides a convenient automotive shopping experience by offering an online platform for buying and selling used cars. Carvana reported revenues of $3.41 billion, up 14.9% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 4.6%. The business had a mixed quarter as\xa0revenue growth regrettably stalled. Carvana achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 34.5% since reporting. It currently trades at $179.24. Is now the time to buy Carvana?  . Founded in 2010 by Harvard Business School student Bom Kim, Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) is a South Korean e-commerce giant often referred to as the "Amazon of South Korea". Coupang reported revenues of $7.32 billion, up 25.4% year on year, in line with analysts’ expectations. It was a softer quarter as it posted a miss of analysts’ buyer estimates. Interestingly, the stock is up 19.1% since the results and currently trades at $24.62.

{'title': 'Analyst reboots Reddit stock price target ahead of earnings', 'content': 'If you all want to live beneath the waves in your Yellow Submarine, you will need a crew. And that\'s where Reddit\xa0 \xa0can help you out. The social media company is teaming up with the U.S. Navy in a recruitment campaign targeting Gen Z. The Navy launched a Reddit-wide role-playing game that calls for players to decipher codes and search for clues to complete command directives, according  . The goal of the " " campaign, which will run through the end of this month, is to help the service attract the next generation of submariners. The Subreddit Hunt seeks out those with “penchants for puzzles,” in which participants must complete several "directives" to finish the game. \xa0The U.S. Navy has advertised on Reddit since 2018. “To ensure we attract the very best and brightest future sailors, including submariners, the Navy is constantly seeking innovative ways to interact with prospective candidates on… social and digital platforms,” said Rear Admiral James P. Waters, commander of Navy Recruiting Command. SOPA Images/Getty Images Many people may know Reddit from the 2021 meme-stock craze when a group of retail investors collaborated on the "wallstreetbets" forum to buy shares of highly shorted companies like GameStop\xa0 , hoping to force short-sellers to buy shares to cover their bearish positions. Keith Gill, alias Roaring Kitty, kicked off the meme-stock craze during the lockdown days of the pandemic, and the story became the subject of the 2023 film “Dumb Money.” Yubo Kuo, assistant professor at Penn State’s College of Information Sciences, said in\xa0 with WallStreetBets, “Investing goes beyond the individual level and becomes a social scene where people form a community to invest together.” "The younger generations are, in general, facing a much harder financial situation," he said. "Research suggests that when people are financially struggling or stressed in general, they tend to engage in more high-risk trading behavior. That\'s what we see in WallStreetBets." Reddit went public in March, and the San Francisco-based company held its first earnings call as a public company in May. Shares are up nearly 47% year-to-date. The company posted second-quarter results on Aug. 6, reporting a loss of 6 cents per share, compared with the expected loss of 32 cents. Revenue increased 54% to $281.2 million, beating the anticipated $254 million. "We kept up our momentum with both strong business performance and progress on the product," co-founder and CEO Steven Huffman told analysts during the company\'s  . "In Q2, both users and revenue grew over 50% year over year. And for the second consecutive quarter, we had positive cash flow and were profitable on an Adjusted EBITDA basis," he added. User growth has continued to climb, Huffman said, reaching new heights with over 342 million weekly active users and more than 91,000,000 daily active users. "More and more people are coming to Reddit to explore their interests, engage in conversations, and find their communities," he said. International expansion remains a top priority and one of the company\'s largest opportunities, Huffman said. "Fifty percent\xa0of our current user base is outside the US, and we believe we can scale this meaningfully over time," he noted. International daily active users exceeded 450 million, growing 44% year over year and 11% from the first quarter, by focus countries like France, India, the UK, and the Philippines, "where we\'re seeing good results with our growth strategies including through machine translation." Huffman said that\xa0immersive machine translation, a form of artificial intelligence that translates text from one language to another without human involvement, is now widely available in French and, "as a result, France was one of our fastest growing countries surpassing\xa0growth in the US." "We will now begin to expand machine translation to German, Spanish, and Portuguese, aiming to make Reddit accessible to everyone regardless of their native language period," The social media company is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Oct. 29. JPMorgan raised the firm\'s price target on Reddit to $77 from $59 on Oct. 7 while keeping a neutral rating on the shares, according to The Fly. The firm updated Reddit estimates ahead of the third quarter results to reflect recent positive trends. The company\'s tone has been upbeat through the third quarter and with the share lock-up expiration behind it, likely upside to estimates, and potential for new large language mode data licensing deals, Reddit has become a much more frequent topic of discussion with investors, the firm said in a research note. However, JPMorgan said that it believes the stock price reflects this recent enthusiasm. Last month, B. Riley initiated coverage of Reddit with a buy rating and $75 price target. The company offers "monetization opportunities aplenty" as it offers a differentiated value proposition to users, advertisers, and content licensees through its "unique" platform powering tens of millions of users across more than 100,000 communities while creating a large and growing repository of curated content, the firm said. Reddit is in a relatively early phase of monetizing the platform through advertising and data licensing and is positioned for healthy top-line growth and margin gains in the coming years, B. Riley said.', 'date': '2024-10-08', 'time': '00:03:00.000', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analyst-reboots-reddit-stock-price-000300546.html'}

{'title': 'Asian Traders Cautious Ahead of China Reopening: Markets Wrap', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Asian stocks were set for a cautious start after losses in the US, with traders preparing for Chinese markets to reopen following a week-long holiday. Most Read from Bloomberg Futures showed Tokyo shares falling, with Hong Kong and Sydney benchmarks inching lower after Wall Street was dragged down by a tech selloff, geopolitical angst and bets on a smaller Federal Reserve rate cut. China-linked stocks could be in for a roller-coaster day, with a briefing by the nation’s top economic planner to be closely watched for more policy measures. A gauge of US-listed Chinese shares was flat overnight, while an index of mainland stocks listed in Hong Kong rose 2.2% on Monday. The S&P 500 fell 1% after notching a four-week winning run. Alphabet Inc. sank 2.4% as a judge ruled it must lift restrictions that prevent developers from setting up rival marketplaces that compete with its Google Play Store. Brent crude jumped above $80 a barrel amid mounting tensions in the Middle East. In the wake of Friday’s solid jobs data, Treasuries continued to drop — with the 10-year yield topping 4%. “Friday’s strong jobs report not only appeared to kill any chance of a 50-basis-point rate cut in November, it kickstarted chatter about the Fed leaving rates unchanged if economic data continues to come in hotter than expected,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “But as last week showed, geopolitics can’t be ignored.” Attention will turn to the Chinese briefing from 10 a.m. local time where officials will discuss a package of policies aimed at boosting economic growth. The government unleashed a slew of stimulus measures before the holiday break, and Chinese shares have soared as the support reinvigorated investor confidence, with the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index jumping 11% since the Golden Week holiday kicked off. Still, Invesco Ltd., JPMorgan Asset Management, HSBC Global Private Banking and Wealth, and Nomura Holdings Inc. are among those viewing the recent rebound with skepticism and waiting for Beijing to back up its stimulus pledges with real money. Some are also concerned many stocks are already reaching overvalued levels. The crisis in the Middle East continues to unnerve investors, with fighting escalating Monday on multiple fronts after a year of war. The Israel Defense Forces said it intercepted most of a barrage of rockets fired toward Tel Aviv by Hamas and other Iran-backed groups. Brent crude soared to its highest price since August as speculation increased that Israel may attack Iran’s oil infrastructure. West Texas Intermediate crude edged higher early Tuesday. To Dave Sekera at Morningstar, if there is any further geopolitical escalation, that would potentially spur the risk-off trade — with growth shares underperforming value ones. “Typically, in a risk-off trade, you’re going to see rotation into defense stocks, but I’d be careful if you’re an investor today,” he said. “Some of the defensive sectors today are already overvalued. Unlike a typical risk-off trade, I think oil stocks would go up.” With the exception of energy shares, every major sector in the S&P 500 dropped Monday. A gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps slipped 1.9%. Amazon.com Inc. sank 3.1% after Wells Fargo Securities downgraded the shares. Apple Inc. slid 2.3% as a Jefferies analyst said investors have overly optimistic expectations for the latest iPhones. Nvidia Corp. gained. Wall Street’s favorite volatility gauge - the VIX - jumped to a two-month high. Treasury 10-year yields rose six basis points to 4.03%. Despite the drop in stocks, two of Wall Street’s top strategists have turned more optimistic on signs of a robust labor market, economic resilience and easing interest rates. Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson raised his view on so-called cyclical stocks relative to safer defensive peers, noting Friday’s blowout payrolls data and expectations of more cuts from the Fed. His peer at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., David Kostin, upgraded his 12-month target for the benchmark to 6,300 points from 6,000. The gauge closed at 5,695.94 Monday. Strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute are reiterating their overweight to US equities and urging to lean into risk, citing cooling inflation and falling interest rates. “The increasing probability that US economic performance will continue to be ‘hot’ going into 2025 and that the Fed will tolerate this heat, provided inflation isn’t reaccelerating, bodes well for risk assets,” said Jason Draho at UBS Global Wealth Management. Corporate Highlights: Amazon.com Inc. must face an antitrust suit filed by the US Federal Trade Commission over its online marketplace, but a federal judge dismissed some of the agency’s claims tied to state consumer protection laws. Activist investor Starboard Value has taken a stake of about $1 billion in Pfizer Inc. and is seeking to spur a turnaround of the struggling pharmaceuticals giant, according to a person familiar with the matter. Chevron Corp. agreed to sell stakes in oil sands and shale assets in Western Canada to Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. for $6.5 billion. Air Products and Chemicals Inc. rallied after a round of positive analyst commentary on the chemical company, including upgrades. The news follows a report that activist investor Mantle Ridge took a stake. Apollo Global Management Inc. agreed to buy Barnes Group Inc. in an all-cash transaction that values the technology and aerospace manufacturer at about $3.6 billion. Rivus Pharmaceuticals Inc., a drug developer focused on obesity treatments, is considering a US initial public offering as soon as 2024, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Continental AG has lined up banks to help with the separation of its struggling car parts business, according to people familiar with the matter, moving ahead with the plans despite recalls related to faulty braking systems it supplied.

{'title': 'Ares Is Said to Agree on Acquisition of GCP’s Ex-China Business', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Ares Management Corp. has agreed to acquire GLP Capital Partners Ltd.’s operations outside of China, people familiar with the matter said, in what could rank as one of the biggest recent combinations in the alternative asset management industry. Most Read from Bloomberg Ares and GCP are set to announce a transaction as soon as Tuesday, the people said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are private. Ares declined to comment, while GCP didn’t have an immediate comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. The firms had been discussing a deal that would feature a roughly $3.5 billion upfront payment, with the total value climbing to around $5 billion over time if certain targets are hit, Bloomberg has reported. GCP has about $66 billion of assets under management outside China, spread across Japan, Southeast Asia, Europe, the US and Brazil. Ares Chief Financial Officer Jarrod Phillips has said that the firm could grow in Asia through acquisitions, and also sees opportunities to expand in infrastructure equity. Alternative asset managers are pursuing mergers to gain scale and expand into new sectors and geographies, turning into one-stop shops offering a range of investment strategies. The deal would expand Ares’s business in one of Wall Street’s hottest areas: infrastructure. GCP has made bets on data centers and renewable energy just as investors look to ride on demand for infrastructure and resources to power what they hope will be an artificial intelligence boom. GCP has traditionally invested in areas such as real estate tied to logistics, digital infrastructure and renewable energy. The firm grew out of Singapore-based GLP Pte, a developer and operator of warehouses that has benefited from the boom in e-commerce. GLP set up a fund management arm to invest third-party money in the sector, and it became a separate entity — GLP Capital Partners — after a series of transactions in 2022.

{'title': "Middle East conflict keeps markets nervous ahead of China's reopening", 'content': 'By Rae Wee SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Global stocks began Tuesday on a cautious note while oil prices stayed elevated as the escalating conflict in the Middle East sapped risk appetite ahead of China\'s highly anticipated reopening after a long holiday. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield held above 4% in early Asia trade, as a robust U.S. labour market prompted traders to heavily scale back their expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. [US/] Hezbollah on Monday fired rockets at Israel\'s third-largest city, Haifa, and Israel looked poised to expand its offensive into Lebanon, one year after the devastating Hamas attack on Israel that sparked the Gaza war. Heightened fears of a widespread conflict and disruptions to supply sent Brent crude futures surging above $80 a barrel for the first time in over a month in the previous session. It was last 0.09% higher at $81.00 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures rose 0.14% to $77.25 a barrel. "The global benchmark hit USD80/bbl as expectations grow that Israel will target Iran\'s oil infrastructure in retaliation for a missile attack last week. President Biden\'s comments didn\'t allay these fears," said analysts at ANZ in a note. "We still think a direct attack on Iran\'s oil facilities is the least likely of Israel\'s retaliation options." Still, the dour mood kept stocks on tenterhooks on Tuesday. MSCI\'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.05%, while Tokyo\'s Nikkei opened 0.79% lower. S&P 500 futures tacked on 0.03% while Nasdaq futures lost 0.01%. But the cautious moves in stocks could change once Chinese markets reopen after a week-long holiday later in the day. Gains and volatility could be on the cards, given Singapore-traded FTSE China A50 futures have rallied some 14% since China\'s cash markets closed on Sept. 30. Hong Kong\'s Hang Seng China Enterprises index was up 11% over the same period, pointing to a catch-up rally for the mainland. Before the break, China announced its most aggressive stimulus measures since the pandemic, in a move which sent the CSI300 soaring 25% over five sessions and sparked a rally across global share markets. Focus will also be on a press conference from the country\'s National Development and Reform Commission due at 0200 GMT, for further details around the stimulus pledges that drove the market frenzy. "Whether the outcome meets any expectations will determine if the Hong Kong market can go up further," said Richard Tang, China strategist and Hong Kong head of research at Julius Baer. "Foreign investors had taken up their positions last week, driving a strong rally. The second leg of the rally will likely be driven by mainland Chinese purchases." FED BETS In the broader market, investors were also considering the future path of the Fed\'s easing cycle in the wake of Friday\'s blockbuster U.S. jobs report. Any chance of another outsized 50-basis-point rate cut next month has since been erased and traders are even pricing in a 14.6% chance that the Fed could keep rates on hold. Just 50 bps worth of cuts are priced in by December. Reflecting the less aggressive Fed easing expectations, the two-year U.S. Treasury yield hovered near its highest level in over a month on Tuesday and last stood at 3.9764%. "While confidence about another 50bp cut is justifiably dampened... the Fed rate cut cycle is far from derailed," said Vishnu Varathan, head of macro research for Asia ex-Japan at Mizuho Bank. "Admittedly, the all-around blockbuster jobs report is justifiable cause to reassess overzealous \'pivot bets\' on front-loaded, outsized cuts." Still, the U.S. dollar failed to get a further lift on the revised Fed expectations, having already had a strong run last week also owing to safe-haven gains linked to the Middle East conflict. It was on the back foot in early Asia trade, falling 0.17% against the Japanese yen to 147.97, while sterling rose 0.03% to $1.3089. Against a basket of currencies, the greenback eased 0.02% to 102.44, though it hovered near a seven-week high hit on Friday. Elsewhere, spot gold was little changed at $2,643.33 an ounce.

{'title': 'Google is about to learn how DOJ wants to remake its empire', 'content': 'Google ( , ) is about to find out what the Justice Department believes should be done to dismantle the tech giant’s dominance of the online search market. Prosecutors are expected to submit a document as early as Tuesday in federal court outlining potential remedies after  . It will be up to District of Columbia District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who sided with DOJ’s monopoly argument, to decide what should happen now in a separate "remedies" phase of the trial that will likely start in 2025. Potential remedies range from an outright breakup of Google, to making its search engine data available to competitors, to ending agreements that secure its search engine as a default on mobile devices and internet browsers. "I think it\'s going to be more complicated coming up with injunctive relief than it was finding the liability," antitrust attorney Carl Hittinger said. Google has promised to appeal. And Judge Mehta could hold off on any orders to alter Google\'s behavior while it challenges his ruling in D.C.’s Circuit Court of Appeals. The judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law on appeal. And even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders to better ensure competition is restored. Certainly, a breakup of Google’s empire — the most rare of antitrust remedies — has the most potential to reorder the tech universe. That could include divestitures of its Android operating system, Chrome browser, or AdWords platform — all of which steer users into Google search. Any one of the three solutions would rip away a multibillion-dollar revenue stream from the tech giant, plus cut off data that fuels its broader search and advertising ecosystem. Legal experts disagree about whether this will actually happen. Hittinger said it’s unlikely because Judge Mehta must select a remedy that best serves the public interest. "You can\'t just yank the rug out from under the American public that\'s been using Google\'s service, now ingrained in our culture, without a substitute," Hittinger said. "Unless other competitors have a platform which is the same or better than Google, what\'s the public supposed to use in the meantime?" A divestment of Android away from Google could have consequences for devices aside from those installed on devices used for internet search. Peloton, for example, uses the open-sourced system to power its exercise equipment. Airplane manufacturers use it to power video screens, and supermarkets use it to run their consumer kiosks. Developers also rely on Google to maintain Android’s ability to work across platforms. Hittinger expects Judge Mehta to fashion a remedy similar to the one imposed against Xerox ( ) in 1975 to end its dominance of the office copier market. The company was no longer allowed to configure its copiers so that ink cartridge suppliers and other third-party components could not run on its machines. But Bill Baer, former attorney general for the Justice Department\'s antitrust division,  he could foresee Judge Mehta requiring Google to divest Android or Chrome. "The judge, in order to make this remedy meaningful, is going to have to do something that allows competition to flourish," Baer said. "Because they\'re a monopolist, they charge the advertisers, who in turn charge us, a whole lot more than if the market were competitive." One likely scenario, antitrust lawyers said, is for the judge to put an end to agreements that secure Google’s search engine as a default on internet browsers and internet-connected devices that use Google’s Android operating system. Google pays as much as $26 billion per year to maintain its position on mobile devices like Apple ( ) and Samsung smartphones. Proskauer antitrust lawyer Colin Kass said he suspects Judge Mehta to be particularly receptive to remedies that undo those contracts because their anticompetitive effects were at the heart of the ruling. "This was a relatively narrow complaint and an even narrower ruling," Kass said. Representatives from Apple and other companies that benefit from the contracts testified that they chose Google for the quality of its search engine. Competing evidence from the DOJ showed Microsoft\'s Bing search engine attracted more users on its Edge browser when Google was not the default option. An end to these revenue-sharing contracts would have considerable consequences for Google and Apple. The contracts — which require Apple to install Google Search as the default across its Safari browser, Spotlight Search, and Siri — bring in an estimated $20 plus billion for Apple each year. Targeted search platforms like Yelp ( ) and Amazon ( ) could also benefit from fewer search users being automatically directed to Google. , an antitrust litigation attorney with Gunster, said device manufacturers and browser services could choose Google as a default even if a court blocks Google from default placement agreements. Plus, he said, it\'s possible that the court could still allow Google to secure default placements for search but under new non-exclusive contracts that don’t raise antitrust concerns. If Google can\'t get default placement any longer, it could also be required to give consumers a choice of search provider. McGinn predicted the DOJ would ask that mobile devices, browsers, and wireless carriers give consumers a choice between search providers. "It’s possible we’ll eventually see more phones and browsers preprogrammed to use another search engine," McGinn said. Last year, the European Union’s antitrust regulator, the European Commission,   Google to give a choice screen based on its determination that the lack of choice violated its antitrust law. The DOJ could also ask the judge to force Google to share with rival browsers and search providers its “click and query” data that it uses to refine its search algorithms. Specifically, the data includes Google’s intellectual property that tracks and learns from information that its search engine users type into its search field and links they choose by clicking on query results. Rival US search providers include Microsoft ( ) Bing, Yahoo Search (owned by Yahoo Finance\'s parent company), and DuckDuckGo. International search providers include Russia’s Yandex and China’s Baidu. A spokesperson for DuckDuckGo told Yahoo Finance before the trial that the company hoped the case would result in Google having to share its click and query data. The data could help more privacy-oriented browsers like DuckDuckGo and search engines compete against Google. The representative said it can be more difficult for DuckDuckGo to attract advertisers because, unlike Google, it does not assemble user search profiles or search histories and then use that data to target users with advertisements. Another remedy that some legal experts expect to be on the DOJ’s list is for Google to temporarily open up its internet index data to rival browser providers, such as Microsoft’s Edge, Apple’s Safari, Mozilla’s Firefox, Brave, and Opera. Even if Google were forced to divest search-related entities or unravel contracts for default placement, these moves may not have a dramatic effect on the company, according to Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill. Its bigger threats, Thill said, are from new AI-assisted search engines and recent gains made by rival Meta in attracting advertisers. "I don\'t think spinning off a browser or an Android operating system is going to have a dramatic impact on the company," Thill said. Judge Mehta, however, may have to consider how remedies to restore competition in the traditional search engine market may impact competition in the emerging market for AI-assisted search. One concern, legal experts said, is that Google\'s search dominance could unfairly entrench its position in the market for next-generation search. At the same time, these fresh threats may work to Google’s advantage in the remedies trial, allowing it to argue that its overall search dominance is already under threat. "If a violation is found, Google will say the market is already solving itself," said former US Federal Trade Commission Chairman and George Washington University antitrust law professor  .', 'date': '2024-10-07', 'time': '16:12:43.000', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-is-about-to-learn-how-doj-wants-to-remake-its-empire-161243461.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGGpALlXLruhtONK4m_HHsSmrifB7zI1i2N0KuGC74_jAkQCtIGgHWa9AHtTf9Dip9v-5TMfXGvTCBCS8QuQ2XOipnUxufLjGw3pubIo4GxzC2C2YHVX-cJnbs9qtqM8qdpygQOWXpPe9tdbK4azz3m2HfMPVc17MBXlOEb-4PQ2'}

{'title': 'Jobs report sends mortgage rates higher', 'content': 'Labor over Inflation has been the theme for   to go lower in 2024, with the understanding that as soon as the labor market softens, the 10-year yield should head lower, which it has. However, it works both ways. Recently, I’ve written that mortgage rates   for 2024 because they got toward the low-end range of my  , and unless the labor market gets much weaker, this is it. Since the    by 0.50% on Sept. 18 the 10-year yield has increased over 35 basis points after a series of better economic data. Retail sales, housing starts, industrial production, jobless claims and now the   came in as a beat of estimates. You put all of those results together and it’s not shocking that the 10-year yield is up over 35 basis points from the recent low. Let’s look at the report to see where we are today. From  :  The headline number beat estimates, and the other positive data line was that we saw positive revisions of 72,000, — which is noticeable. Wage growth even picked up in this report, and the unemployment rate for those without a high school education fell from 7.1% to 6.8%. With the positive revisions in this report and the headline number, the labor market is now slightly beating my forecast for job growth in 2024. I have been looking for the monthly job gain data to cool down toward 140,000-165,000 per month as we head toward 159 million total nonfarm payroll employed. Today, we stand at 159,105,000; if this didn’t happen I would have needed to revise all my labor models. However, now that we are here, the labor data looks more accurate than I saw earlier in the year. I expect this number to be revised lower in time, but even with negative revisions, the labor market is getting softer, not breaking. Breaking would mean jobless claims are rising and heading toward 323,000 on the four-week moving average, and that’s not happening. However, for now, the labor data aligns with what I have been looking for. This is also one reason I have been discussing how mortgage rates have bottomed for 2024. This is the updated three and six-month average job creation data; both are slightly above my target level for job creation numbers. 3-month average: 185K 6-month average: 166K Here is the breakdown of the monthly labor prints: As we can see, construction labor grew again. Lower mortgage rates   have made life easier for the homebuilders. Their confidence has been increasing so much that single-family permits are rising again, which is critical to keeping residential labor employed. We have already seen the benefit of lower mortgage rates. The question going out is can this continue? Now that rates have increased, smaller builders who can’t pay down rates will feel the pinch again. We will track this religiously as it’s such a key variable in the economic cycle and for the Fed. Will we see revisions to this report? Most likely. Is the labor market getting softer? Yes, but it’s not breaking, at least not yet. One of the benefits of lower mortgage rates has been that single-family permits are picking up again as demand grows. As we can see, the builders will pull back on permits when rates get too high. We have enough data to show that mortgage rates in the high 6% range or over 7% are simply too high of a rate to grow home sales in 2024. This for both new and existing home sales, so I am encouraged to see that we can show benefits to the economy with lower mortgage rates, and we don’t have to be so scared of mortgage rates heading toward 6% or going lower in the future.', 'date': '2024-10-04', 'time': '19:37:44.000', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobs-report-sends-mortgage-rates-193744279.html'}

{'title': 'Solid Earnings Will Spur Hope Japan Stocks Hold Onto 2024 Gains', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Investors are counting on solid earnings to help Japanese shares hold their gains in the final stretch of a volatile year that saw the market go from one of the world’s top performers to the epicenter of a global meltdown. Most Read from Bloomberg While unlikely to revisit the record hit in July, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average may finish the year up 1.3% from its current level to 39,844, according to the average forecast of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg from Sept. 27 to Oct. 7. The broader Topix will tick up 2.1% to 2,797, the average estimate of seven analysts showed, bringing the annual increase to 19% for the Nikkei 225 and 18% for the Topix. Analysts have been upgrading the Topix earnings outlook throughout this year, with forward looking earnings-per-share rising to about 188 points, as the yen’s strength wanes and companies pass on higher input costs to consumers. Net profits at Japan’s 500 biggest listed companies hit an all-time high of ¥15 trillion ($101 billion) in the quarter ending in June. “There’s a list of things that worry investors, but that hasn’t completely ruined sentiment,” said Daisuke Uchiyama, a senior strategist at Okasan Securities Co. in Tokyo. The outlook for resilient corporate earnings may help lift Japanese stocks toward December, he said. The biggest threat to earnings would be a resurgence in the yen, which has jumped 12% against the dollar over the past three months as the Bank of Japan moved closer toward normalizing monetary policy. The Topix suffered its first quarterly loss in two years in the three months ending September 30. Meanwhile, China’s stock market rebound may draw attention away from Japan. Since Beijing’s bumper stimulus announcement on Sept. 24, the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index has surged 25%, while the Topix rose 0.1% China’s Sudden Stock Rally Sucks Money From Rest of Asia “We are still positive on Japan structurally as we see nominal growth and earnings moving higher,” said Alexander Wolf, the head of Asia Investment Strategy at JP Morgan Chase Bank NA. While he’s marginally more positive on China because of recent stimulus measures, Japanese equities have upside potential, he said. Analysts have been raising their outlooks for company profits more than lowering them, though there have been notable differences across sectors, according to an earnings revision index compiled by Goldman Sachs. Banks are on the positive side while some exporters such as transport equipment makers are negative. Concerns over the yen are posing less of a problem for exporters right now as the interest rate gap between the US and Japan narrows at a slower pace, said Ikuo Mitsui, a fund manager at Aizawa Securities Co. Companies will also successfully pass on higher input costs to customers, he added. “There is a strong possibility that corporate earnings won’t be as bad as the market thought because of the strong yen,” said Mitsui, who favors infrastructure names including Hitachi Ltd., since they are less affected by recessions.

{'title': "Here's Why Sui Is One Crypto Investors Are Loading Up On Today", 'content': "In the cryptocurrency world,   is a project many investors may be unaware of. Currently the 18th-largest crypto project by  , Sui has nonetheless been one of the best performers over the past month, surging roughly 124% over this time frame. Over the past 24 hours alone, Sui has surged 12.4% as of 3 p.m. ET, making this project among the best-performing large-cap tokens out there. Sui's recent surge over this past month can be directly attributed to the announcement that Circle's USDC stablecoin will be launched on the Sui network. This announcement took place on Sept. 17, and as of the time of this writing, Sui's native token is up almost exactly 100% since the day before this announcement. That's a very reasonable return in a very short amount of time for investors. Now, the question is whether this momentum can continue. Let's dive more into this specific catalyst, and what it may portend for Sui's performance moving forward. Circle's USDC stablecoin is the second-largest such token in the world, and is the currency in which a significant percentage of on-chain transactions take place in. For investors bullish on Sui's Layer-1 blockchain and smart contract network, the ability for this particular project to innovate in the decentralized finance space by simplifying and improving the efficiency of various applications improves when the world's second-largest stablecoin is accepted as currency on this network. Many investors seem to believe that the inclusion of the Circle stablecoin into Sui's network will encourage developers to build more applications on-chain, growing the Sui network and creating certain network effects which may be hard for competitors to break. I think it's certainly an encouraging development, though the question now is whether Sui's recent run has more than priced in this potential catalyst, in light of some of the macro headwinds we're starting to see form. In terms of crypto projects with major catalysts (and major momentum), Sui certainly stands out as a top project worth considering. The blockchain network's underlying technological infrastructure is impressive, and this USDC integration should bode well for growth, so long as the Sui team continues their work on improving the user experience and driving new and exciting ways to use the Sui network forward. For now, this token is one that certainly looks to have major potential as a breakout candidate through the end of the year.

{'title': 'Q2 Earnings Outperformers: Reynolds (NASDAQ:REYN) And The Rest Of The Household Products Stocks', 'content': "The end of an earnings season can be a great time to discover new stocks and assess how companies are handling the current business environment. Let’s take a look at how Reynolds (NASDAQ:REYN) and the rest of the household products stocks fared in Q2. Household products stocks are generally stable investments, as many of the industry's products are essential for a comfortable and functional living space. Recently, there's been a growing emphasis on eco-friendly and sustainable offerings, reflecting the evolving consumer preferences for environmentally conscious options. These trends can be double-edged swords that benefit companies who innovate quickly to take advantage of them and hurt companies that don't invest enough to meet consumers where they want to be with regards to trends. The 10 household products stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 1% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 0.5% above. Big picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled. Thankfully, household products stocks have been resilient with share prices up 5% on average since the latest earnings results. Best known for its aluminum foil, Reynolds (NASDAQ:REYN) is a household products company whose products focus on food storage, cooking, and waste. Reynolds reported revenues of $930 million, down 1.1% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 4.2%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ gross margin and organic revenue growth estimates. “Strong retail revenue performance in each of our business units resulted in RCP outperforming our categories during the quarter,” said Lance Mitchell, CEO and President of Reynolds Consumer Products. Reynolds delivered the weakest full-year guidance update of the whole group. Interestingly, the stock is up 3.3% since reporting and currently trades at $29.53. Is now the time to buy Reynolds?  . A leader in multiple consumer product categories, Spectrum Brands (NYSE:SPB) is a diversified company with a portfolio of trusted brands spanning home appliances, garden care, personal care, and pet care. Spectrum Brands reported revenues of $779.4 million, up 6% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 3.8%. The business had a very strong quarter with an impressive beat of analysts’ organic revenue growth estimates. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 13.1% since reporting. It currently trades at $92.57. Is now the time to buy Spectrum Brands?  . Originally founded as a Wisconsin paper mill in 1872, Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) is now a household products powerhouse known for personal care and tissue products. Kimberly-Clark reported revenues of $5.03 billion, down 2% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 1.3%. It was a slower quarter as it posted a miss of analysts’ organic revenue growth estimates and a miss of analysts’ gross margin estimates. As expected, the stock is down 3.1% since the results and currently trades at $139.62. Best known for its Arm & Hammer baking soda, Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) is a household and personal care products company with a vast portfolio that spans laundry detergent to toothbrushes to hair removal creams. Church & Dwight reported revenues of $1.51 billion, up 3.9% year on year. This number was in line with analysts’ expectations. Zooming out, it was a satisfactory quarter as it also produced an impressive beat of analysts’ organic revenue growth estimates but underwhelming earnings guidance for the full year. The stock is up 1% since reporting and currently trades at $101.04. Founded in 1913 with bleach as the sole product offering, Clorox (NYSE:CLX) today is a consumer products giant whose product portfolio spans everything from bleach to skincare to salad dressing to kitty litter. Clorox reported revenues of $1.90 billion, down 5.7% year on year. This result missed analysts’ expectations by 2.4%. Aside from that, it was a strong quarter as it produced an impressive beat of analysts’ organic revenue growth estimates. Clorox had the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth among its peers. The stock is up 20.3% since reporting and currently trades at $161.30.

{'title': 'Starboard Value takes $1 billion stake in Pfizer: Reports', 'content': 'Pfizer\'s stock ( ) surged more than 4% Monday morning after reports that activist investor Starboard Value had taken a $1 billion stake in the pharma giant. The investor wants to help turn around the company\'s lackluster performance in recent years,   late Sunday evening. Pfizer declined to comment. Pfizer\'s stock has been stagnant despite its COVID revenue windfall. Investors have instead been focused on an underwhelming portfolio, several blockbusters facing patent expiry in the next few years, and reduced revenues since the end of the pandemic. "The stock has been held in check over the past year, trading between the mid $20s to low $30s and not doing much outside of a pretty tight range. Longer-term, this is one of the most disappointing names in large-cap healthcare with an uninspiring chart over almost any duration dating back to the 1990s," wrote Mizuho\'s healthcare expert Jared Holz in a note to clients Monday. CEO Albert Bourla has attempted to put a spotlight on the company\'s aggressive strategy, from betting his entire pension on the company\'s stock earlier this year to the $43 billion Seagen deal and  in the second half of 2023. During the pandemic, when other COVID players saw their stocks spike, . Despite being the lead vaccine in the US and in some countries around the world, Pfizer\'s stock was not similarly rewarded. Bourla remained optimistic then, telling Yahoo Finance, "We do think our stock is undervalued, but we do not worry that investors cannot see it." By 2023, Bourla sounded weary. "Although I\'m not happy, all we can do is to execute on our strategy so that investors will see that this is a good growth opportunity," Bourla told Yahoo Finance. In 2021, then CFO Frank D\'Amelio, who has been   as a consultant, told Yahoo Finance, "There\'s a lot more value to unlock. Investors will start to warm up more to the story." That hasn\'t happened. Despite meeting its target of 6% growth in the top line over the last few years — even after steep COVID declines — investors haven\'t warmed up. The stock peaked at $60 per share in December 2021 when the company filed jointly with partner BioNTech ( ) for FDA approval of its COVID vaccine in teenagers — a year after adults had access. Bourla has struggled to convince Wall Street of Pfizer\'s value since taking the helm in 2019. At the time, Pfizer was   with a GSK ( ) joint venture and had spun off its generics business Upjohn. The company was just starting to contend with the idea that it had products facing a patent cliff by the end of the coming decade. At the time, Bourla made a commitment during an earnings call to showcase Pfizer\'s ability to be a large-cap company that operates as a lean and efficient machine with both internal research and dealmaking. "Pfizer will be a smaller, more focused science-based company with a singular focus on innovative pharma. We also will still have the financial flexibility to continue to invest in growth while returning capital to our investors. These are deliberate steps we are taking to make Pfizer a very different company," Bourla said on a second quarter earnings call in 2019. Fast-forward to 2024, and the company has made good on some promises, but that hasn\'t moved the needle for Wall Street. The company has made a number of deals, including reinvesting its COVID windfall, roughly $86 billion from 2021 through 2023. The deals from 2019 through the present total $73.7 billion. That includes the Seagen deal, as well as $5.4 billion for Global Blood Therapeutics and $11.6 billion for Biohaven. "The entire concept of PFE’s aggressive business development strategy and lack of return (so far) is likely one of the major reasons behind the Starboard stake," Mizuho\'s Holz wrote. "So it is not overly surprising to see a firm such as Starboard make an attempt to change the trajectory of the Company, despite the fact that a material operational improvement may not be the simplest of tasks." Leerink Partners analysts similarly wrote in a note Monday that the company\'s revenue growth is constrained for the next five years. "We await future developments, but we do not see low-hanging fruit to boost shareholder value," the analysts wrote.', 'date': '2024-10-07', 'time': '17:02:43.000', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starboard-value-takes-1-billion-stake-in-pfizer-reports-170029653.html'}

{'title': "Takeaways from AP's report on affordable housing disappearing across the U.S.", 'content': 'LOS ANGELES (AP) — While Americans continue to struggle under  , as many as 223,000 affordable housing units across the U.S.   in the next five years alone. It leaves   facing protracted eviction battles, scrambling to pay a two-fold rent increase or more, or shunted back into a housing market where costs can easily eat half a paycheck. Those affordable housing units were built   or LIHTC, a federal program launched in 1987 that provides tax credits to developers in exchange for keeping rents low. It has pumped out 3.6 million units nationwide, and its expansion is now central to Democratic presidential candidate   housing plan  . The catch? The buildings typically only need to be kept affordable for a minimum of 30 years. For the wave of LIHTC construction in the 1990s, those deadlines are arriving now, threatening to hemorrhage affordable housing supply when Americans need it most. How many affordable units could be lost in the coming decades? Data on LIHTC units that will lose their affordability nationally remains a rough estimate. The best nationwide analysis estimated that by 2030 roughly 350,000 LIHTC units are at risk of losing affordability. That’s 1 million units by 2040, according to the National Housing Preservation Database. Not all units that lose LIHTC’s affordability protections become market rate. Some are kept affordable by other government subsidies, by merciful landlords or by states, including California, Colorado and New York, that have worked to keep costs low. Still, it’s a sizeable loss to a housing market already in dire need of new units. “If we are losing the homes that are currently affordable and available to households, then we’re losing ground on the crisis,” said Sarah Saadian, vice president of public policy at the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “It’s sort of like having a boat with a hole at the bottom,” she said. What can be done to stop the loss of affordable units? Local governments and nonprofits can purchase expiring apartments, new tax credits or other subsidies can be applied that extend the affordability, or tenants can organize to try to force action from landlords and city officials. California now requires all new LIHTC properties to be affordable for 55 years. Expiring developments built before that rule are also prioritized for new tax credits, and the state essentially requires that all LIHTC applicants have experience owning and managing affordable housing. California and Colorado require landlords to notify local governments and tenants before their building expires. Cities and nonprofits then have first shot at buying the property to keep it affordable. However, unlike California many states haven’t extended LIHTC agreements beyond 30 years, let alone taken other measures to keep expiring housing affordable. Still, local governments or nonprofits scraping together the funds to buy apartment buildings is far from a guarantee. And while new tax credits can reup a lapsing LIHTC affordability, they are limited, doled out to states by the Internal Revenue Service based on population. What happens to tenants when their LIHTC unit loses affordability? For more than two decades, the low rent on Marina Maalouf’s LIHTC apartment in Los Angeles’ Chinatown was a saving grace for her family, including a granddaughter who has autism. When that grace expired, the landlord, no longer legally obligated to keep the building affordable, hiked rent from $1,100 to $2,660 in 2021 — out of reach for Maalouf and her family. Tenant protests, a rent strike and eviction filings followed. The eviction case is ongoing, haunting Maalouf’s nights with fears of her family ending up in sleeping bags on a friend’s floor or worse. Mornings she repeats a mantra: “We still here. We still here.” But fighting day after day to make it true is exhausting. Still, Maalouf’s tenant activism has helped move the needle. The City of Los Angeles has offered the landlord $15 million to keep her building affordable through 2034, but that deal wouldn’t get rid of over 30 eviction cases still proceeding, including Maalouf’s, or the $25,000 in back rent she owes. On a recent day in the courtyard of Maalouf’s apartment, her granddaughter shuffled up with a glass of water. She is 5 years old, but with special needs, her speech is more disconnected words than sentences. “That’s why I’ve been hoping everything becomes normal again, and she can be safe,” said Maalouf, her voice shaking with emotion. She has urged her son to start saving money for the worst. “We’ll keep fighting,” she said, “but day by day it’s hard. ... I’m tired already.” ___ Bedayn is a corps member of The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

{'title': 'Q2 Earnings Roundup: Napco (NASDAQ:NSSC) And The Rest Of The Electrical Systems Segment', 'content': 'Wrapping up Q2 earnings, we look at the numbers and key takeaways for the electrical systems stocks, including Napco (NASDAQ:NSSC) and its peers. Like many equipment and component manufacturers, electrical systems companies are buoyed by secular trends such as connectivity and industrial automation. More specific pockets of strong demand include Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity and the 5G telecom upgrade cycle, which can benefit companies whose cables and conduits fit those needs. But like the broader industrials sector, these companies are also at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact projects that drive demand for these products. The 15 electrical systems stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.8% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 2.1% below. Inflation progressed towards the Fed\'s 2% goal recently, leading the Fed to reduce its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent or 0.5%) in September 2024. This is the first cut in four years. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be debating whether this rate cut\'s timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. Thankfully, electrical systems stocks have been resilient with share prices up 5.1% on average since the latest earnings results. Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:NSSC) is a leading manufacturer and designer of high-tech electronic security devices, cellular communication services for intrusion and fire alarm systems, and school safety solutions. Napco reported revenues of $50.33 million, up 12.7% year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations, but overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with a narrow beat of analysts’ earnings estimates. Richard Soloway, Chairman and CEO, commented, "Fiscal 2024 concluded with record revenue and net income for both the 4th quarter and the full fiscal 2024 year ending June 30, 2024." Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 29.7% since reporting and currently trades at $38.99. Is now the time to buy Napco?  . Originally a metal-working shop supporting local petrochemical facilities, Powell (NYSE:POWL) has grown from a small Houston manufacturer to a global provider of electrical systems. Powell reported revenues of $288.2 million, up 49.8% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 29.7%. The business had an incredible quarter with an impressive beat of analysts’ earnings estimates. Powell pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth among its peers. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 81.9% since reporting. It currently trades at $242.48. Is now the time to buy Powell?  . Founded in 1961, Kimball Electronics (NYSE:KE) is a global contract manufacturer specializing in electronics and manufacturing solutions for automotive, medical, and industrial markets. Kimball Electronics reported revenues of $430.2 million, down 13.3% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 3.6%. It was a disappointing quarter as it posted full-year revenue guidance missing analysts’ expectations. Kimball Electronics delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and weakest full-year guidance update in the group. As expected, the stock is down 14.3% since the results and currently trades at $17.51. Protecting the things that power our world, Atkore (NYSE:ATKR) designs and manufactures electrical safety products. Atkore reported revenues of $822.4 million, down 10.5% year on year. This result was in line with analysts’ expectations. Taking a step back, it was a disappointing quarter as it logged underwhelming EBITDA guidance for the full year. The stock is down 31.3% since reporting and currently trades at $81.41. Managing over 165 million tolling transactions per year, Verra Mobility (NYSE:VRRM) is a leading provider of smart mobility technology that enhances safety, efficiency, and convenience on roadways. Verra Mobility reported revenues of $222.4 million, up 8.8% year on year. This result was in line with analysts’ expectations. More broadly, it was a slower quarter as it recorded full-year revenue guidance missing analysts’ expectations. The stock is down 1.8% since reporting and currently trades at $27.15.

{'title': 'Private Equity-Backed Texas Housing Development Taps Muni Market', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- In suburban Texas, a neighborhood complete with an amphitheater, dance hall and goat farm is scheduled to be erected 40 miles from Houston’s downtown — providing municipal-bond investors a window to bet on one of the fastest-growing areas of the US. Most Read from Bloomberg In a transaction that priced this week, a municipal authority sold high-risk, tax-exempt bonds to finance infrastructure associated with a housing development dubbed Two Step Farm. The planned community stretches more than 2,000 acres in Houston’s sprawling metropolis. The first phase will have more than 1,000 homes priced between $350,000 and $1 million, as well as parks and amenities. The bonds are backed by future revenues generated by the project, meaning investors are wagering that the development will be built out and populated. Texas metros are seeing the most sustained population growth of all the nation’s major cities this year, according to US Census Bureau data. Houston added nearly 140,000 people to its population this year, following closely behind Dallas. San Antonio and Austin also ranked in the top 10 of the largest increases in new residents. “Texas is a high-growth state, and Houston’s a high-growth area. So this is something where the demographics really do support building this development,” David Mann, senior investment analyst at Manulife Asset Management, said. “Families are going to move here. They’re gonna work somewhere in the area. That’s one of the major things that’s attractive about it.” The sale builds on an already strong year for real estate backed transactions in the muni market. Known as dirt deals, developers have been tapping investors to help finance a range of projects — from a luxury golf enclaves to a revamp of Atlanta’s downtown hub. Broadly, high-yield munis have performed well this year, with such debt up 7.9% in 2024, besting the broader market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Two Step Farm is being developed by Oxland Group – a residential development company – and JEN Partners – a private equity firm whose primary investment platform is residential real estate. The first phase of the project “will feature a dance hall inspired by original dance halls from the 1800s throughout South and Central Texas; plus, a working goat farm, farm shop and café, and taproom,” said Tom Woliver, co-president and founder of Oxland Group. “More traditional amenity offerings will include a coworking space, nature trails, and a swimming pool.” The securities are capital appreciation bonds, meaning investors don’t receive regular interest payments, but the return is fully paid when the bonds are due. For example, the Two Step Farm project is borrowing $60 million at issuance, a value that will accrete to about $110 million at maturity in 10 years. Such a structure can be “fairly risky” if the construction of the development is disrupted or if the growth of the surrounding area starts to wind down, according to Chad Farrington, co-head of municipal bond strategy at DWS Group. “In the meantime you haven’t collected any interest or been paid a coupon, and now you’re left with a development that probably has a lot less value than how much debt is on the property,” he said. Those risks are noted within offering documents. The securities are unrated and offered only to qualified institutional buyers and accredited investors — indicative of a high level of risk. Investment in the bonds “involves a significant degree of risk and is speculative in nature,” the bond documents say. The bonds are due in 2034 and priced with a 6.125% yield, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. (Corrects details about the first phase of the project in the second paragraph.)

{'title': '‘I’m scared to death’: My wife asked for a divorce after 21 years. She wants to buy a house with our savings, but promises to help pay my mortgage.', 'content': 'My wife of 21 years informed me that she wants to divorce. We jointly own a home with nine years left on the mortgage. Our savings account contains a large sum of readily available cash that we use for emergency funds, college tuition and living expenses for our son — and as a hedge should one of us lose our job. She says she wants to use all of the savings to buy her own place and that she would help me continue to pay the mortgage on our current home should I choose to continue to live there (and I do plan to stay put). I will have to fully cover all the household expenses and, since her salary is higher than mine, this leaves me barely covering expenses on my own. She would cover half of our son’s college expenses (for two more years until he graduates). There is more than enough money in the savings to completely pay off the current mortgage. I’m scared to death of losing my job and having nothing to fall back on without savings and am three years away from full retirement. What — in your opinion — would be the better use of the savings? I don’t see that she can take the whole amount since it is in both our names. Should the savings account be split 50/50 or is it better to eliminate the current mortgage and defer her getting her half when the current home is sold sometime in the future? Soon-to-be Single   Her plan sounds messy, and it leaves too much up to chance. Your joint savings account does not go to your wife: No-one gets to plunder all these accounts, and make promises for what will happen after you’re divorced. This is where codependency ends and a new life of independence begins. You don’t have to manage your wife’s expectations, you only have to manage your own, and she may or may not agree with you.\xa0If she doesn’t? That’s too bad (for her). Maryland is not a community property state, meaning the assets may not be distributed 50/50; consult a lawyer, but if you earn less than your wife, you may be entitled to a higher settlement. Just keep in mind that if your wife wants to empty that joint savings account, there’s nothing to stop her doing it while you were both married. A judge may not look kindly upon such actions, but it’s better to safeguard your assets now. There may be lots of room for compromise when it comes to paying for tuition for your son, or how long you decide to hang onto the family home, or whether you should use the savings account to sell the house now. But if you feel like your savings provide you with peace of mind, especially as you earn less than your wife, stick to that. (Americans should have around six months of emergency savings in the event that something bad happens, yet most do not.  .) There’s a lot you can do  . First off, hire your own lawyer and let them be bad cop to your good cop. Be civil, polite, kind and stick to your goals. While you await the negotiations, take an inventory of your life insurance policies and retirement accounts (including IRAs and 401(k)s) and think about who you might want as a beneficiary in lieu of your soon-to-be ex-spouse. In addition to the divorce decree when you or your wife decide to file papers, you may need a “Qualified Domestic Relations Order” — a court order that requires workplace retirement benefits or IRAs to be split. You’re not alone. More baby boomers are getting divorced, studies show —   — and will likely be more concerned about retirement given they are closer to retirement age, currently 66. When you consult a divorce lawyer, think creatively. Will you be doing any renovations on the home? If so, that should be deducted from any final sale. If you alone are paying the mortgage and your wife does receive some amount of money to put a down payment on her own home, then your wife shouldn’t benefit from the full sale price either. If you cannot agree to an amicable split of assets, the court will intervene on both your behalf. Your wife has very clear ideas about what she wants from this divorce, so it may be wise to freeze any joint bank accounts before your divorce is finalized. It may not be what she gets, but you should also know exactly where you draw the line and areas that are open for negotiation.

{'title': 'Housing market recovery threatened by mortgage rate pop', 'content': 'Home sales and home prices have been improving for several weeks. Unfortunately, this period could be fleeting, because we had strong   last week. Ironically, a strong employment situation in the country drives the bond market to higher rates. After the recent lows with   this week, the 30-year fixed rate jumped back up over 6.5%. It looks like the September refinance boomlet has backed off. The purchase market is slower to respond, and the data now is still showing the positive impact of lower rates of recent weeks.  bounced back up over the last couple days, and it demonstrates how fragile this   recovery could be. The fact is that as   fell closer to 6% home prices and home sales have been showing pretty obvious gains over last year. Leading indicators, such as price reductions, have topped out. Even the withdrawal rate of frustrated home sellers declined over the last month. Last year’s  . There were very few buyers in the fourth quarter 2023. So, having more now isn’t like a big  , but it shows that consumers do get motivated as the cost of money gets cheaper. Conversely, if mortgage rates don’t stay low, we’ve seen homebuyers very willing to wait. The conventional wisdom is that mortgage rates will generally continue to move lower, but there’s no reason that must be true, as evidenced in the last few days. There are 362,000 single-family homes under contract. That’s been climbing all September from 357,000 earlier in the month. It was just under a 1% increase this week. This is measuring the total count of homes that are under contract now. We’re showing 6% more homes under contract now than last year. Homes stay under contract for 30 to 40 days. At the end of the month, a bunch of sales close. There’s a step down each month for the first week of the month. Next week, we’ll start October with fewer sales still in the process. The median price for the homes that people are buying — those that went under contract this week — is $395,000. It has surprised me that for four weeks in a row, this measure of home prices has ticked up. Usually, we expect home prices to ease down in the fall. These new pendings prices rose by 1.25% this week, to $395,000 and are 5% greater than a year ago. In the last two years, when October had sharply higher  , home sales were tanking and prices were dropping. The opposite is happening now. I don’t expect this to continue. But, this is a stronger signal than I expected for resilience of the  . This is the price point people are buying. This recent trend implies that the yearly home price appreciation has a little more room than we’ve been expecting. The median price of all the homes on the market is now $440,000, that’s unchanged from last year. The available   of unsold homes on the market ticked up to 734,000 single-family homes. That’s up half a percent for the week and is 36.7% more homes on the market than a year ago. Some of the Sunbelt states, like Arizona, Texas and Florida haven’t topped out with inventory yet. Texas has 44% more homes on the market that last year and 24% more unsold homes on the market now than in 2019.\xa0Arizona has 70% more homes on the market now than a year ago. Nationally, we have 36.7% more homes unsold than last year, but we’re still 23% fewer homes on the market now than in 2019. There are eight states with more inventory now than in 2019. In addition, we see hurricane impact in North Carolina, Georgia and Florida with fewer new listings, more withdrawals, and fewer new pendings. Asheville metro had a 40% drop in sales during the week. And it’ll probably drop further this coming week. There were 61,000 new listings unsold this week — down a few percentage points for the week and a fraction more than a year ago. The immediate sales are at their lowest levels since we started tracking during the pandemic. These are the bidding wars and homes that get offers immediately after listing. These are the best homes in the best locations that are properly priced and well marketed. It’s notable that, while we’re measuring a slight pickup in total sales and the prices being paid are holding firm, the urgency of buyers is not increasing. Homebuyers are in a much stronger position than they have been in many years. Just about 40% of the homes on the market have taken a price reduction from the original list price. This percentage has been staying flat for a couple months now. One way to measure the slight improvement in   over the last month is that price reductions haven’t climbed at all. Rates spiked in the autumn of 2022. At that time, the pace of withdrawals accelerated and price cuts climbed. It’s wild how quickly the sentiment can change in a week. We were maybe at a transition point to see some home sales growth, and suddenly we had a big mortgage rate spike. Buyers can put the brakes on quickly.', 'date': '2024-10-07', 'time': '19:50:57.000', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/housing-market-recovery-threatened-mortgage-195057624.html'}

{'title': 'Chinese Sovereign Bonds Extend Stimulus-Led Slump After Holidays', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- China’s government bonds declined as trading resumed after a one-week holiday, as demand for haven assets dropped amid bets a historic stock rally may extend thanks to Beijing’s stimulus blitz. Most Read from Bloomberg The yield on China’s most actively traded 10-year bond rose seven basis points to 2.22% on Tuesday. That’s after the rate climbed in the days leading to the Golden Week break, as traders flooded into the stock market after officials unleashed stimulus measures including interest-rate cuts and initiatives to support the ailing property sector. The stocks frenzy continued on Tuesday as the benchmark CSI 300 Index climbed almost 11% in early trading before paring its advance, while the onshore yuan declined as much as 0.6%, the most in almost two months. Speculation that the nation’s top economic planner will unveil more stimulus measures on Tuesday was also adding to the bearishness in the bond market. The selloff in bonds underscores growing optimism in the Chinese economy as investors plough money into riskier assets. It also marks a swift turnaround in sentiment from last month when yields touched record lows amid doubts over China meeting its growth target of around 5% this year. The sudden downturn in bonds may raise the risk of redemptions from wealth management products that powered the record rally in sovereign debt for most of this year. That could trigger a negative loop where retail investors rushing to sell their debt products worsens the rout. “It is most likely mainly reflecting a portfolio rebalancing from bonds to equities as many investors are chasing the equity rally,” said Lynn Song, greater China chief economist at ING Bank NV. He doesn’t expect a vicious cycle of downturns in the bond market and sees focus returning to China’s challenging growth outlook.

{'title': "A Gen Xer can't find a job after 1,000 applications despite years of 6-figure roles: 'It's like playing the lottery'", 'content': 'Sean Tetpon, 55, has applied for more than 1,000 jobs in the past year without success. Tetpon, a former communications manager, was laid off in 2019 and again in 2023. He suspects ageism and intense competition in his industry are factors. Sean Tetpon, 55, held   positions for years as a communications manager for major companies. But with his now having unsuccessfully applied for   over the past 12 months, he and his wife have had to cut every expense possible — and are considering bankruptcy. Tetpon was financially stable for most of his adult life, working at various large companies, though he was laid off in 2019. In between job applications, he   and landed a job in 2021. But he was laid off again in 2023 and hasn\'t landed anything since. "When the   come out, and they paint this rosy picture, it\'s not reflecting what\'s happening in the white-collar job market over the past year," Tetpon said. "There continue to be   in corporate America, and as a result, I\'m seeing, for the roles that I apply for, many highly qualified candidates out there all competing for a finite number of jobs." Tetpon suspects his age and his industry\'s intense competition have affected his ability to  . Still, he hasn\'t given up hope and is staying positive in his job search. "At first, it was disheartening because, like everyone else, I need employment to take care of my family and to pay my bills, but to run into over 1,000 people  , I get nervous when there are 100 applicants for the same job," Tetpon said. "But I applied for them anyway because you never know. It\'s like playing the lottery." Tetpon was the first in his family to get a four-year degree, graduating from the University of Idaho with a bachelor\'s in public communications. While in college, he got an internship at IBM, which he parlayed into a full-time role and an over 15-year career. He became a global communications manager, which paid him six figures. He then bounced to a few other companies in similar positions. Despite a  , he said, he struggled financially for a few years, as one of his five children had a major heart defect, leading to "steep medical bills." Tetpon first experienced   from 2019 to 2021, with his first layoff coming shortly before many companies paused hiring during the pandemic. To keep money coming in, he drove for Uber and Lyft and freelanced for corporate clients between "cumbersome" applications. Tetpon secured a job in 2021 and switched to another position the following year. But then he was unexpectedly laid off in September of last year. He was given a basic severance package, which included a free option to work with a job-placement agency, which helped him improve his résumé and interview strategies. "Each layoff, it\'s been a little harder to bounce back because the job market started constricting again right around the time I was laid off," Tetpon said. Tetpon has submitted more than 1,000 job applications since that layoff. He estimates that it takes almost an hour to apply for a job. "Job seeking initially has become a full-time job again — seven, eight hours a day applying for roles," Tetpon said. "This came back to bite me mentally because it\'s such a draining process." Of these  , he\'s had nearly 30 interviews, and he made it to the final round for three positions. He said he\'d tried tailoring his résumé and cover letter to each position and emphasized characteristics of his portfolio that make him stand out. Between job applications, Tetpon drives five days a week for  , earning about $3,000 a month. He said he valued the flexibility of setting his own hours to prioritize interviews and applications. He\'s looking to get back into retail work, even at minimum wage, in positions he enjoys, such as working at a record store. The layoff has put his family\'s financial situation in jeopardy. To make ends meet, he moved into his mother-in-law\'s home. He and his wife, a full-time medical-technology student with little income, axed many subscriptions, bought the cheapest groceries for about $130 a week, and cut unnecessary spending. Tetpon still has student and credit debt, and he\'s considered bankruptcy as an option. He says he has just 10% of what he\'d originally saved left in his 401(k), and he fears he may have to work for the rest of his life. "It\'s scary because I\'ve been preparing for   for a long time, but now that I\'ve basically wiped out savings because of my layoff, I\'m now wondering if I will be able to retire," Tetpon said. Tetpon identified three reasons he suspects he hasn\'t landed a job yet. The first is how his field of corporate communication is highly competitive and prone to layoffs. He said even for smaller companies offering much less than what he earned, hundreds of people would apply, and he would be lucky to land an interview. He said he\'d had little luck applying for in-person roles in metro Atlanta and had seen fewer remote opportunities. Screenshots shared with BI reveal Tetpon applied for positions receiving nearly 4,000 applications just on  , not counting people who applied directly. Tetpon\'s second reason was that many companies are nervous about the economy and the coming US elections and are being particularly selective about hiring decisions. He suspects employers are looking for the perfect candidate who fits every aspect of the job description instead of someone with 80% of the skills but with drive. Part of this, he suspects, derives from  . While he hasn\'t been able to prove it, he believes for some roles, companies will pass over his application because they want to hire younger talent. "A lot of companies look at somebody like me with 25 years of experience in the six-figure range, and they have to weigh that against somebody much younger, maybe even recently out of college, who could come in at a much lower range," Tetpon said. Tetpon\'s third reason is related to the mental struggle of applying to positions daily. Recently, he\'s questioned whether he\'s networking enough, applying to the right roles, or spending enough time on applications, which sometimes clouds his efforts. Still, he said he\'d seen employment struggles across the age spectrum. Some of his children are struggling to find their first role, and he\'s seen an uptick in LinkedIn posts from people of all ages looking for work. Tetpon said he learned to customize résumés for each position by including keywords in job descriptions so applications wouldn\'t immediately get rejected. He\'s also become more aggressive about networking, reaching out to his past colleagues, and having them send open roles or issue referrals. Tetpon added that taking mental-health breaks is key to the job hunt, as job seekers are already "dealing with the psychology of losing a job and sense of purpose." He believes he will land somewhere soon, noting his experience speaks for itself. "I want to give job seekers some hope based on what I\'ve learned over the past year because while it is tough out there, we can\'t give up, and I certainly haven\'t given up," Tetpon said. "Eventually, the pendulum will swing, and they need to be ready to capitalize on that."

{'title': 'Ex-Goldman CFO Returns to Wall Street Atop $55 Billion Housing Giant', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Stephen Scherr, the former chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is seeking a Wall Street comeback by joining the leadership of one of the biggest investors in US housing. Most Read from Bloomberg Scherr starts this week as co-president at Pretium, a major landlord of US single-family homes founded by his former Goldman colleague Don Mullen. The new hire will share his post atop the $55 billion investment firm with another heavyweight Mullen recruited last year: former Morgan Stanley CFO Jon Pruzan. “The firm has grown extremely fast. I need to be in a position that I have people around me that, if I get hit by a bus, can run the place,” Mullen, 66, said in an interview. “That doesn’t mean that, if I drop dead, they come out of a glass case to run the place. There’s a lot to do now.” That includes expanding the firm. “Bringing folks like that on board is going to put us in a position to be able to grow in a reasoned and mature way,” he said. “We are still a tween in our growth path.” Scherr, 60, spent most of his career at Goldman, including his last three years as finance chief, until 2021. The banker then ran car-rental company Hertz Global Holdings Inc. before stepping down from that role in March as the company teetered from its mistimed bet on electric vehicles. In joining Pretium, he returns to the familiar turf of finance, this time focusing on a residential real estate market that’s being reshaped by giants. Mullen made a shrewd bet in the aftermath of the US foreclosure crisis, snapping up homes at depressed prices as he walked neighborhoods in California and Arizona. He has since expanded Pretium, amassing a portfolio of almost 100,000 rental homes and plowing deeper into more corners of real estate. That includes a nascent bet on apartment buildings. For investors, the multifamily market has presented opportunities, as some landlords and their lenders fret over a wave of loan maturities, and as some parts of the country work through a supply glut. Pretium is also in the business of originating and servicing home loans and is looking to bulk up in real estate debt. Pretium has grown at a moment of deep public frustration over the lack of affordable housing. That’s turned attention — and scorn — toward Wall Street players. Both Republican and Democratic leaders have argued institutional investors are making it tougher for people to buy their first homes. Large investors have countered by arguing they own only a small percentage of US rental homes and are offering a valuable alternative to buying. “We should be part of the solution even if we are seen by some as a part of the problem,” Mullen said. He added that Pretium has worked with some mayors to address the housing challenge. Earlier this year, Mullen agreed to sell a minority stake in his firm to Bennett Goodman’s Hunter Point Capital in a deal to help fund expansion. Scherr said the ambition is to be “bigger and larger.” While there there are other markets and areas where Pretium can expand, it doesn’t need to stray far from its chief remit. “The organization understands where it has edge and is quite disciplined in areas of real estate where it can make headway,” he said. “There’s a lot to do there long before we go further afield.” Scherr will be working alongside Pruzan after the duo spent years at competing banks jostling for investor attention, often presenting public updates on successive days, seeking to talk up their firms’ shares. “I used to tell my team my second-favorite stock was Morgan Stanley,” Scherr said. “The theory was that it would rub off and help the Goldman Sachs multiple. I think the two of us can coexist pretty well at the same firm.” Private Credit Pruzan and Scherr have been friends longer than rivals. As Pruzan was exiting Morgan Stanley, it was Scherr who hooked him up with Pretium. In fact, the pair were vacationing together last year when the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank set off tumult in US banking. While they no longer have to obsess over banking regulations and valuations, they’re feeling the repercussions of tempered lending at troubled regional banks. That’s opening up an attractive business line for Pretium, which wants to marry its presence in niche local markets with the ability to also finance homebuilders and developers in those areas. Construction lending as a percentage of the overall loan portfolio at banks has dropped to 4% from 8% in 2006, according to regulatory data compiled by Pretium. It will lead to only more business for nonbank players, according to Pruzan. “Banks are becoming less relevant in certain lending spaces,” Pruzan said. “The next private-credit market is going to be around residential real estate. The opportunity set is huge.” --With assistance from Patrick Clark.

{'title': "Billionaire Bill Ackman Has 53% of His Hedge Fund's $10.6 Billion Portfolio Invested in Just 3 Stocks", 'content': ' is one of the best-known billionaire investors in the world. His hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital, focuses on a few high-quality businesses where Ackman feels the stock has become mispriced, relative to its value. He will then buy shares and use his influence to unlock shareholder value. As an  , he can focus on only so many businesses at once. That means he only swings at what he thinks are his biggest opportunities. As a result, Pershing Square has a highly concentrated portfolio, and just three stocks account for more than 53% of the entire $10.6 billion in public equity holdings.    has grown to become Ackman\'s largest position for Pershing Square. The investor first accumulated shares of the largest hotelier in the world in 2016, but it wasn\'t until 2018 that he had an opportunity to establish a significant position in the stock during the market downturn. "Hilton\'s extensive and growing network of brands and properties offers a significant and self-reinforcing value proposition to both guests and hotel owners, which creates a strong competitive moat around the business," Ackman wrote to investors in 2018. That moat has only gotten stronger as Hilton expanded its brand count to 24 and counts over 7,700 participating hotels. Its loyalty program has grown from 80 million, when Ackman invested in 2018, to over 195 million today. The two create a network effect: As more hotels join the Hilton portfolio, it attracts more customers to the loyalty program, and vice versa. Hilton has been growing quickly to support its expansion. Revenue per available room grew 3.5% in the second quarter, and management expects full-year growth between 2% and 3%. It also has a pipeline of 508,300 more rooms in development. As Hilton expands its management operations, it should see nice margin expansion as it increases revenue per room. While Ackman sold some Hilton shares to make room for smaller new positions in the second quarter, his firm still holds about 9 million shares worth $2.1 billion. That makes it his largest position. At its current price, it trades near the high end of its historical enterprise value-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) range, excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Investors may want to review Hilton more carefully before following Ackman\'s lead. While many saw artificial intelligence (AI) as a major threat to  \'s     main Google search business, Ackman saw the opportunity for the company to take advantage of recent innovations in AI. He bought shares of the company in the first quarter of 2023, just as the AI boom was getting started. He has since added to his position and now holds 7.5 million C shares and nearly 4 million A shares. Combined, they\'re worth about $1.9 billion. Google\'s position as one of three big public cloud platforms has resulted in strong operating results for its Google Cloud business. It surpassed $10 billion in quarterly revenue in the second quarter, up from $7.3 billion at the end of 2022. Alphabet is spending heavily on AI to support the growth of Google Cloud and build new AI features in Google Search. The efforts have paid off as management says its new AI overview feature in search has increased engagement and satisfaction with search results. That said, the company has cut expenses in other areas, leading to an expanding operating margin. The stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of around 20. Meanwhile, analysts expect AI and other trends to drive earnings growth at Alphabet above 20%, on average, for the next five years. That makes Alphabet a very attractive stock at its current price. Ackman established an initial position in     in 2016 after food safety concerns led to a huge sell-off for the stock. He gobbled up 2.9 million shares by the end of that year. While he\'s sold about 80% of that position since then, Chipotle remains one of Pershing Square\'s largest holdings, worth about $1.6 billion. He cited Chipotle\'s strong brand, differentiated product, and substantial scale as reasons for believing the company could recover from its food safety challenges of the previous year. He saw an opportunity for the chain to double its store count from approximately 2,200 at the end of 2016. Today, traffic has more than recovered, and Chipotle operates 3,530 restaurants. Management said it envisions opening 7,000 locations long term. Chipotle is seeing strong performance from existing stores, even as it opens new locations at a strong pace. Same-store sales increased 11% in its most recent quarter, driven by both transaction volume and average ticket sizes. It\'s also building on its Chipotlanes drive-thru concept, which includes about 80% of new-store openings. These can help drive higher same-store sales growth. Strong same-store sales have led to improved restaurant-level operating margins, which climbed to 28.9% in the second quarter, up 140 basis points year over year. Chipotle recently lost its CEO Brian Niccol to  . As CEO since 2018, he was largely responsible for much of the recovery and success at the company since Ackman took a position in late 2016. However, Chipotle has an excellent playbook for success and a long runway for continued growth. That said, the stock\'s valuation has grown to reflect the company\'s strong prospects. Shares currently trade at 44 times earnings estimates for next year. With that kind of premium, investors may be better off waiting for a pullback before placing their next order for Chipotle stock.

{'title': 'China markets reopen with a roar after week-long break', 'content': 'SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese shares soared to two-year highs on Tuesday, pushing a blistering rally even further as trade resumed after a week-long holiday and investors bet on stimulus supporting the economy. The blue-chip CSI300 was up 10% in early trade to its highest since mid-2022 and the Shanghai Composite rose 9.7% and hit its best levels since December 2021. Hong Kong\'s Hang Seng, which hit 2-1/2 year highs on Monday, slumped 2.8%. The yuan fell sharply to 7.0502 per dollar and five-year bond futures dropped to their lowest since July. A press conference from the National Development and Reform Commission called for 0200 GMT is in focus for further details of the stimulus pledges behind the market frenzy. Before the break, China announced the most aggressive stimulus measures since the pandemic and the CSI300 gained 25% over five sessions. Turnover soared as heavy buying strained brokers and trading systems, and last Monday the CSI300 and the Shanghai Composite both notched their largest gains since 2008. Authorities have cut rates and hinted at fiscal support to shore up an economy that, by Chinese standards, is ailing. Before the Golden Week holiday break, hedge fund manager David Tepper said on CNBC the moves were encouraging enough that he would buy "everything" on China. But gains have been so large that others now urge caution. "China\'s weighting in the MSCI EM Index rose from 24% in Aug to 30% now, and its continued outperformance may drive a self-reinforcing \'pain-trade\' before the year-end," Bank of America analysts said in a note on Monday. However, they said, the "\'buy everything\' stage will be over soon," with market momentum, fiscal support, earnings, the U.S. election and further policy settings all part of the outlook. "Consumer, property (and) broker stocks could be profit-taking candidates ... big cap internet and high-yield SOEs are our preferred exposure," they said.

{'title': 'As affordable housing disappears, states scramble to shore up the losses', 'content': 'LOS ANGELES (AP) — For more than two decades, the low rent on Marina Maalouf’s apartment in a blocky affordable housing development in Los Angeles’ Chinatown was a saving grace for her family, including a granddaughter who has autism. But that grace had an expiration date. For Maalouf and her family it arrived in 2020. The landlord, no longer legally obligated to keep the building affordable, hiked rent from $1,100 to $2,660 in 2021 — out of reach for Maalouf and her family. Maalouf\'s nights are haunted by fears her yearslong eviction battle will end in sleeping bags on a friend\'s floor or worse. While Americans continue to struggle under  , as many as 223,0000   units like Maalouf\'s across the U.S.   from under them in the next five years alone. It leaves   protracted eviction battles, scrambling to pay a two-fold rent increase or more, or shunted back into a housing market where costs can easily eat half a paycheck. Those affordable housing units were built with the  , or LIHTC, a federal program established in 1986 that provides tax credits to developers in exchange for keeping rents low. It has pumped out 3.6 million units since then and boasts over half of all federally supported low-income housing nationwide. “It’s the lifeblood of affordable housing development,” said Brian Rossbert, who runs Housing Colorado, an organization advocating for affordable homes. That lifeblood isn’t strictly red or blue. By combining social benefits with tax breaks and private ownership, LIHTC has enjoyed bipartisan support. Its expansion is now central to Democratic presidential candidate   housing   to build  . The catch? The buildings typically only need to be kept affordable for a minimum of 30 years. For the wave of LIHTC construction in the 1990s, those deadlines are arriving now, threatening to hemorrhage affordable housing supply when Americans need it most. “If we are losing the homes that are currently affordable and available to households, then we’re losing ground on the crisis,” said Sarah Saadian, vice president of public policy at the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “It’s sort of like having a boat with a hole at the bottom,” she said. Not all units that expire out of LIHTC become market rate. Some are kept affordable by other government subsidies, by merciful landlords or by states, including California, Colorado and New York, that have worked to keep them low-cost by relying on several levers. Local governments and nonprofits can purchase expiring apartments, new tax credits can be applied that extend the affordability, or, as in Maalouf’s case, tenants can organize to try to force action from landlords and city officials. Those options face challenges. While new tax credits can reup a lapsing LIHTC property, they are limited, doled out to states by the Internal Revenue Service based on population. It\'s also a tall order for local governments and nonprofits to shell out enough money to purchase and keep expiring developments affordable. And there is little aggregated data on exactly when LIHTC units will lose their affordability, making it difficult for policymakers and activists to fully prepare. There also is less of a political incentive to preserve the units. “Politically, you’re rewarded for an announcement, a groundbreaking, a ribbon-cutting,” said Vicki Been, a New York University professor who previously was New York City’s deputy mayor for housing and economic development. “You’re not rewarded for being a good manager of your assets and keeping track of everything and making sure that you’re not losing a single affordable housing unit,” she said. Maalouf stood in her apartment courtyard on a recent warm day, chit-chatting and waving to neighbors, a bracelet with a photo of Che Guevarra dangling from her arm. “Friendly,” is how Maalouf described her previous self, but not assertive. That is until the rent hikes pushed her in front of the Los Angeles City Council for the first time, sweat beading as she fought for her home. Now an organizer with the LA Tenants\' Union, Maalouf isn’t afraid to speak up, but the angst over her home still keeps her up at night. Mornings she repeats a mantra: “We still here. We still here." But fighting day after day to make it true is exhausting. Maalouf\'s apartment was built before California made LIHTC contracts last 55 years instead of 30 in 1996. About 5,700 LIHTC units built around the time of Maalouf\'s are expiring in the next decade. In Texas, it’s 21,000 units. When California Treasurer Fiona Ma assumed office in 2019, she steered the program toward developers committed to affordable housing and not what she called “churn and burn," buying up LIHTC properties and flipping them onto the market as soon as possible. In California, landlords must notify state and local governments and tenants before their building expires. Housing organizations, nonprofits, and state or local governments then have first shot at buying the property to keep it affordable. Expiring developments also are prioritized for new tax credits, and the state essentially requires that all LIHTC applicants have experience owning and managing affordable housing. “It kind of weeded out people who weren’t interested in affordable housing long term,” said Marina Wiant, executive director of California’s tax credit allocation committee. But unlike California, some states haven\'t extended LIHTC agreements beyond 30 years, let alone taken other measures to keep expiring housing affordable. Colorado, which has some 80,000 LIHTC units, passed a law this year giving local governments the right of first refusal in hopes of preserving 4,400 units set to lose affordability protections in the next six years. The law also requires landlords to give local and state governments a two-year heads-up before expiration. Still, local governments or nonprofits scraping together the funds to buy sizeable apartment buildings is far from a guarantee. Stories like Maalouf\'s will keep playing out as LIHTC units turn over, threatening to send families with meager means back into the housing market. The median income of Americans living in these units was just $18,600 in 2021, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. "This is like a math problem,” said Rossbert of Housing Colorado. “As soon as one of these units expires and converts to market rate and a household is displaced, they become a part of the need that’s driving the need for new construction.” “It’s hard to get out of that cycle,” he said. Colorado\'s housing agency works with groups across the state on preservation and has a fund to help. Still, it\'s unclear how many LIHTC units can be saved, in Colorado or across the country. It\'s even hard to know how many units nationwide are expiring. An accurate accounting would require sorting through the constellation of municipal, state and federal subsidies, each with their own affordability requirements and end dates. That can throw a wrench into policymakers\' and advocates\' ability to fully understand where and when many units will lose affordability, and then funnel resources to the right places, said Kelly McElwain, who manages and oversees the National Housing Preservation Database. It\'s the most comprehensive aggregation of LIHTC data nationally, but with all the gaps, it remains a rough estimate. There also are fears that if states publicize their expiring LIHTC units, for-profit buyers without an interest in keeping them affordable would pounce. “It\'s sort of this Catch-22 of trying to both understand the problem and not put out a big for-sale sign in front of a property right before its expiration,” Rossbert said. Meanwhile, Maalouf\'s tenant activism has helped move the needle in Los Angeles. The city has offered the landlord $15 million to keep her building affordable through 2034, but that deal wouldn\'t get rid of over 30 eviction cases still proceeding, including Maalouf\'s, or the $25,000 in back rent she owes. In her courtyard, Maalouf\'s granddaughter, Rubie Caceres, shuffled up with a glass of water. She is 5 years old, but with special needs, her speech is more disconnected words than sentences. "That’s why I’ve been hoping everything becomes normal again, and she can be safe,” said Maalouf, her voice shaking with emotion. She has urged her son to start saving money for the worst. “We\'ll keep fighting,” she said, “but day by day it\'s hard.” "I’m tired already.” ___ Bedayn reported from Denver. ___ Bedayn is a corps member of The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

{'title': 'A Look Back at Analog Semiconductors Stocks’ Q2 Earnings: ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) Vs The Rest Of The Pack', 'content': "As the Q2 earnings season wraps, let’s dig into this quarter’s best and worst performers in the analog semiconductors industry, including ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) and its peers. Demand for analog chips is generally linked to the overall level of economic growth, as analog chips serve as the building blocks of most electronic goods and equipment. Unlike digital chip designers, analog chip makers tend to produce the majority of their own chips, as analog chip production does not require expensive leading edge nodes. Less dependent on major secular growth drivers, analog product cycles are much longer, often 5-7 years. The 15 analog semiconductors stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 1% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 1.2% below. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal recently, leading the Fed to reduce its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent or 0.5%) in September 2024. This is the first cut in four years. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be debating whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. Analog Semiconductors stocks have held steady amidst all this with average share prices relatively unchanged since the latest earnings results. Spun out of Motorola in 1999 and built through a series of acquisitions, ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is a global provider of analog chips specializing in autos, industrial applications, and power management in cloud data centers. ON Semiconductor reported revenues of $1.74 billion, down 17.2% year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations, but overall, it was a slower quarter for the company with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and an increase in its inventory levels. “We remain dedicated to driving growth through market share gains, doubling down on investments in strategic markets, and expanding the breadth of our portfolio of industry-leading products with analog and mixed-signal solutions,” said Hassane El-Khoury, president and CEO, onsemi. Interestingly, the stock is up 1.8% since reporting and currently trades at $71.45. . Taiwan-based Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) is a leading manufacturer of display driver chips and timing controllers used in TVs, laptops, and mobile phones. Himax reported revenues of $239.6 million, up 2% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 2.9%. The business had an exceptional quarter with a significant improvement in its gross margin. Although it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 4.3% since reporting. It currently trades at $5.61. Is now the time to buy Himax?  . Serving major consumer electronics manufacturers, Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED) is a provider of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies used in display and lighting applications. Universal Display reported revenues of $158.5 million, up 8.1% year on year, in line with analysts’ expectations. It was a softer quarter as it posted a miss of analysts’ EPS estimates and full-year revenue guidance missing analysts’ expectations. As expected, the stock is down 2.3% since the results and currently trades at $207.60. Founded in 1997 by its longtime CEO Michael Hsing, Monolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ:MPWR) is an analog and mixed signal chipmaker that specializes in power management chips meant to minimize total energy consumption. Monolithic Power Systems reported revenues of $507.4 million, up 15% year on year. This number topped analysts’ expectations by 3.4%. It was a strong quarter as it also recorded optimistic revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decent beat of analysts’ EPS estimates. The stock is up 18.1% since reporting and currently trades at $928.22. Headquartered in Dallas, Texas since the 1950s, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is the world’s largest producer of analog semiconductors. Texas Instruments reported revenues of $3.82 billion, down 15.6% year on year. This print met analysts’ expectations. Aside from that, it was a slower quarter as it logged a decline in its operating margin. The stock is up 1.8% since reporting and currently trades at $201.81.

{'title': "Forget cold plunges or biohacking: Here's how Wall Street's rising stars stay sharp", 'content': 'Wall Street\'s top performers are hard workers who tend to work long, intense hours. Business Insider asked its 2024 class of Wall Street stars about how they stay mentally sharp. Here\'s how finance professionals are unwinding and staying grounded. Call it superstitious, but Mark Zhu, a 34-year-old managing director at Blackstone, likes to start every day the same way. He has two Trader Joe\'s yogurt cups, one banana-flavored and one blueberry-flavored, eaten in the same order, followed by his supplements, which also have their specific sequence. "Those are just examples of how I bring a level of consistency and sequencing to my life," he said. "Because you know the moment after 9 o\'clock, the days can get chaotic." Similarly, the 90 minutes between 5:30 a.m. to 7 a.m. are precious to Craig Kolwicz. The Moelis investment banker uses that time to put himself in control for the rest of the day, whether by going to the gym, meditating, or reading a book. "You\'re not getting pulled in all different directions with your deals, your transactions, or just things in life," said the 35-year-old managing director. "It\'s sacred time to me — anything before 7 a.m. is my time." It\'s no secret that working on Wall Street is demanding. Finance giants from Blackstone to Goldman Sachs attract some of the brightest and most driven people, and to climb the ranks is no easy feat. When we asked top up-and-comers on Wall Street about the habits or routines they followed to keep themselves mentally sharp, no one mentioned , 10-step facial rituals, or   trends that tout themselves as life hacks that instantly make you more attractive, healthier, smarter, and more balanced. Most of these high performers featured on   are spending time with their families, keeping physically and mentally healthy with reasonable workout and  , and finding opportunities to recharge. Here\'s what we learned about the hacks, habits, and routines that help top talent on Wall Street stay on their game. Chicago-based Bank of America investment banker Corey White is another early riser. He relies on his Apple watch to wake him up gently, with a little vibration at 5 a.m. The 35-year-old works out. He\'s partial to weight lifting but recently took up running thanks to his twin brother, who works in private equity. He sends his kids off to school and listens to a podcast on an hour-long commute into the office. "My mornings are super important to me to have a nice, kind of slow start to the day. And I found it\'s regulating," he told BI. The routine helps him stay present with his home life as well as work, he added. Nina Gnedin, a San Francisco-based portfolio manager from Man Group, starts her day at 4:30 a.m. because she works East Coast market hours. "I wake up. I do my face. I do my skincare. I brush my teeth. I drink my double shot of espresso. I do all my morning work rituals, where I check the trades. I check on the portfolios around 7, 7:30. I get coffee again." Her "very regimented" workday ends at 3 p.m., which allows her to get outside and enjoy the outdoors. "There\'s no day of the year where the sun\'s down when I\'m done with work," she said. Bridgewater Associates deputy chief investment officer Blake Cecil likes to push himself (and his team) to meet deadlines that might be arbitrary on paper but give him a mental goal to chase. The 32-year-old overpromises on projects intentionally to " trick" himself into working more efficiently and diligently. One example is he will ask his team and himself this hypothetical: "Let\'s imagine we had to deliver this in 24 hours — how would we do that?" Often, this leads to creative and innovative work, he told BI. BlackRock\'s Chi Chen, 34, winds down her weekends with a Sunday evening reading ritual that helps her "distill my brain." It\'s a two-hour affair, starting with one hour of the books she\'s reading. The fixed-income portfolio manager is a fan of non-fiction and just read "Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst" by Robert Sapolsky. After that, she turns back to the markets. She reads external and internal research and prepares for the week. Since starting at Bank of America, Justin Elliott has had a daily regimen designed to take up his 20-minute commute to work. "It\'s really around my faith — I do a devotion. Read a Bible scripture, pray. Come into the office and listen to a gospel song," the 29-year-old vice president on the institutional rates sales desk at Bank of America told BI. "That\'s my every morning routine for getting me centered for the day. It\'s about reminding me why I\'m here and what it\'s all about." He also goes to the gym two to three times a week and has recently been doing sound baths and meditation with his wife. Listening to music on her drive to her Boston office helps Fidelity Investments\' Palmer Osteen, 31, take her mind off what\'s about to come and what\'s ahead so she can start her workday with a clear head. It also works for her way home. Music "helps me reset and decompress and not go to bed with a hamster wheel in my brain," she said. KKR\'s Alissa Song, who grew up in Silicon Valley but now lives in New York, uses the time to touch base with family and friends. "It just keeps me connected to the people I care about," the 31-year-old industrials investor told BI. "I\'ve been doing this since my college internships." "Part of it is just that we came to the US when I was really young, and so here it\'s just the four of us here, my two parents and my brother. And so we\'re really close," she added. "That\'s been a way that I\'ve kept in touch." Similarly, making time for quality time with friends and family keeps Daniela Cardona, 29, grounded. "I work a ton," the RBC investment banking vice president said, but "most important is I\'ve never lost sight of my friends, my support system." Bank of America\'s White has a family day every Saturday with his wife and two young sons. "We go to the museums, go to the zoo, go to the water park, wherever it is, we just fully, deeply focus on our family," he said. "And I think being able to give 100% to whatever you\'re focused on is really important for just productivity, but also for the mental side of I\'m here right now in the moment with my family and being fully immersed in that." Ben Carper, who finished his   open water certification a couple of years ago, tries to take a trip or two a year with his wife that focuses on diving. Along with a chance to see exotic locations, it\'s a chance to completely unplug. "It\'s a change of scenery, and it\'s kind of hard to think about work when there\'s a 25-foot manta ray swimming nearby," Carper, a 34-year-old managing director on Jefferies\' Private Capital Advisory team, added. His last dive was in the Maldives, and he\'s eyeing Thailand next. Matthew Eid-Holm, a principal at Ares Management, skis or scuba dives at least every 6 months. "A few hours of these activities that require 100% focus on the present are very effective at resetting," the 32-year-old told BI. Also, on the ocean theme, Moelis\' Kolwicz is a pretty avid surfer. "Being out on the ocean, getting that physical activity — it\'s easy to zone out." There are ways to decompress and relax on land, too. Melissa Ding, an infrastructure investor at BlackRock, likes to engage in meditative activities like cooking, pottery, or tending to her terrace garden to give the 33-year-old a "little bit of mental reset." "When I need a little bit of rest time, there are just things that I do that where I can kind of zone out." Her garden consists of flowers, including dahlias, and a recently planted fig tree. Wells Fargo\'s Annie Cheslin, 34, recently learned how to play the centuries-old strategy game mahjong, which she\'s become "obsessed with." The managing director in high-grade municipal trading joined a club that meets twice a month to play. Physical challenges are a way to distract yourself from the day-to-day and counterbalance the time you spend in front of computer screens or client dinners. Margaret Williams, a 31-year-old executive director at Morgan Stanley, said she exercises in some form or fashion every day. Williams will do anything, from a run in Central Park to weightlifting to laps at a hotel pool on the road to late-night walks with the dog. "It\'s a part of staying balanced, physically and mentally," she said. Being disciplined about daily workouts is also how Apollo\'s Austin Anton, 32, clears his head. "I find that when I go for a run, I have my most creative ideas, and I love to run, and I tend to do that every other day," he said. "So I find that very helpful in terms of clearing my head and allowing me to think through something." Erica Wilson\'s workout of choice is weightlifting, which "has become a real stress reliever over the last couple of years," she told BI. The 31-year-old vice president at Blue Owl\'s daily habit has evolved into a competitive hobby. She participated in a power-lifting competition last year through Tone House — she deadlifted nearly twice her body weight — as well as Hyrox,   featuring eight separate physical exercises, such as sled pulls or burpee broad jumps, with a 1-kilometer run in between each. For Harrison DiGia, morning is the best time to get a workout in. "I try to wake up and move my body. I do some sort of workout every morning, whether it\'s strength training, playing tennis, or even stretching or yoga," the 31-year-old General Atlantic vice president said. "I\'m a huge tennis player. I like using that time in the morning to clear my mind. It helps me reset and gets me ready for the new day ahead." Patrick Lenihan, a portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, has a strict bedtime. "There\'s some nights where you need to get things done, but I try to have a hard cutoff. Let\'s just say 9:30— that\'s lights out." That gives him 30 or 45 minutes to wind down and ensure he gets his sleep, not just for physical health, but mental, too. He also makes a point to stay active. He played hockey his whole life, but after a few surgeries, he now does lower-impact exercises like pilates and barre at least three or four times a week. "Now that I\'m on paternity leave, I\'ve been lucky enough to do it, get in a little bit more. But I think those two things help me to at least stay recharged and stay ready each day," he said. Luckily, his infant son is a great sleeper and has not disturbed Patrick\'s rest so far. "I definitely think getting sleep is important," Elizabeth Stone Redding, a principal at TPG, told BI. "It\'s certainly something I have realized as I\'ve matured in my career, that you really need to use your brain, and you need to get a decent amount of sleep for that." The 33-year-old also habitually sets priorities to stay on track and not get overwhelmed. "It\'s very easy to obviously be overwhelmed with a large list of things, but narrowing it down and saying, \'Okay, these are the two or three things I really want to do today,\' helps me a lot," Stone Redding said. "I try to have — even if it\'s just in my head — a list of two or three things I want to accomplish in a given day." Matt Gilbert, a 35-year-old managing director at Thoma Bravo, started working with an executive coach a few years ago. He was surprised when the coach pushed him to pull back at work. "I would say, in general, workaholic or \'Type A\' people tend to try to grasp more and more responsibility," he said. "And I actually think ultimately that was the case for me." Gilbert now spends more time with his family. He has made a habit of watching TV with his wife every night and dropping his oldest daughter at school. "I think I fill up my cup in terms of personal fulfillment so that my time that I\'m at work, I can really, really focus and dedicate to that and kind of maximize the time that I have here." Gidan Dan\'s key ritual at work is consistently staying in touch with his clients, but at home, the Citadel Securities senior vice president takes the chance to relax. "A lot of my colleagues are really good runners and they work out and everything. I\'m completely different," he said. "I think I work long enough hours, so I don\'t want to exhaust myself too much. So I would just go home, and taking care of my kids is enjoyable but exhausting stuff," Dan said of his two daughters, aged 1 and 4. Feroz Khosla, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, isn\'t just looking for work-life balance, but "work-life harmony — which just means, when you look back at your career, you feel as if there was harmony between work and life," he told BI. "Sometimes, you do need to have the power to say no, but do it gracefully," he said. "Maybe the answer is sure, but not right now—and being able to do that without disappointing people is super helpful."

{'title': 'Google Play App Store Faces Revenue Hit as Antitrust Woes Mount', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. must lift restrictions that prevent developers from setting up rival marketplaces and billing systems that compete with its Google Play Store, a judge ruled, upending the search giant’s dominance in the lucrative Android app market and probably denting its revenue. Most Read from Bloomberg A federal judge in San Francisco on Monday handed a big victory to Epic Games Inc. in its long-running challenge to the technology giant’s app store, another antitrust blow to Google following its recent major defeat in one US Justice Department case and while it’s still fighting another. The ruling comes after the maker of the popular video game Fortnite convinced a jury that Google abused its power in the Android app market with its Google Play store policies. The changes the company must now make will almost certainly take a bite out of its sales, with one analyst estimating a “worst case” loss in gross profit of more than $1 billion off sales that totaled $14.66 billion in 2020. Alphabet shares fell as much as 2.5%, closing at $162.98 in New York. They had been up 20% this year through the end of last week. “The Epic verdict missed the obvious: Apple and Android clearly compete,” Google said in a blog post. “We will appeal and ask the courts to pause implementing the remedies to maintain a consistent and safe experience for users and developers as the legal process moves forward.” App Store Controls In a case that started in 2020, Epic argued that Google Play rules and fees stifled competition and blocked app marketplaces launched by developers. The judge’s decision is likely to accelerate the weakening of app store controls held by tech giants Google and Apple Inc. that have been under fire from regulators and lawmakers around the world. US District Judge James Donato issued an injunction that takes effect Nov. 1 which bars Google for three years from paying developers to exclusively use its app store or prohibit them from telling customers about how to directly download apps. Google also cannot force developers to use its billing features during that time. The company must also let rival app stores have access to its catalog for the next three years in a bid to help them develop. The increased use of third-party billing systems by media and gaming companies in light of Donato’s injunction poses a larger threat to Google than rival app stores, Mandeep Singh, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note. “In a worst case scenario this could be a 20-30% drag on gross app store sales of around $50 billion, mostly subscriptions, which could be a $1-$1.5 billion drag on the company’s gross profit, based on our estimates,” Singh said. Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, an analyst with EMarketer, agreed that Google will take a revenue hit, though she said it will take a while to “fully materialize” because the company’s play store will remain the default choice on Android devices. “Even if Google Play Store is no longer pre-installed as a result of payments to device manufacturers, it has tremendous brand recognition among consumers,” she said. Epic Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney, who has been fighting both Google and Apple for four years to open their stores, hailed Monday’s decision as a victory in a post on X. Donato had warned he would be tough on Google after jurors found in December that the company had engaged in anticompetitive conduct and harmed Epic. “The question at hand is not whether Google violated the antitrust laws by failing to aid rivals, but what measures are necessary to restore fair competition in the face of the barriers found by the jury,” he wrote. “Requiring Google to allow other app stores to be distributed through the Play Store for a discrete period is a modest step to correct the consequence of unlawfully preventing rival stores from reaching users and developers,” Donato said. ‘Reasonable Measures’ In its defense, Google contended that its partnerships help phones that run on Android better compete against Apple’s iPhone. The judge said that Google can take “reasonable measures” to ensure the security of its platform, and ordered the parties to recommend three people for a committee to review the technical aspects of those requirements. Developers who find that Google’s security measures are too stringent can challenge them, with the tech giant responsible for proving they are necessary. Donato said he limited the injunction to three years because “the provisions are designed to level the playing field for the entry and growth of rivals, without burdening Google excessively.” Google had told the judge it would take 12 to 16 months to add third-party apps to the Play Store, but Donato set a deadline of eight months. Stanford University law professor Mark Lemley called the judge’s decision “important,” saying it’s particularly significant that Donato ordered Google to make its catalog of apps available to competing stores. “That isn’t something antitrust law would normally require,” he said. “But the judge correctly noted that once you have violated the antitrust laws, courts can order you to do affirmative things to undo the harm you caused, even though you didn’t have the obligation to do those things in the first place.” Epic-Apple Fight Epic had mixed success with a similar antitrust challenge to Apple’s app store. A judge in Oakland, California, concluded in 2021 that the App Store didn’t violate federal monopoly laws. But the judge sided with Epic on an unfair competition claim under California law and directed the iPhone maker to let developers steer customers to their websites for online transactions. The Fortnite maker claimed in its suit against Google that the tech company monopolized the Android app distribution market for more than a decade by striking side deals with rivals and using its resources to thwart competition. During trial, Epic presented evidence that Google forged partnerships with phone makers including Samsung Electronics Co. to ensure Google Play was pre-installed on mobile devices. Donato’s ruling would stop Google from using a payment, revenue share or access to Google’s services as conditions in agreements with device makers or wireless carriers in exchange for its Google Play store to be prominently featured on devices. A Google public policy executive said in the company’s blog post that Monday’s ruling will have “unintended consequences.” “As we have already stated, these changes would put consumers’ privacy and security at risk, make it harder for developers to promote their apps, and reduce competition on devices,” Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company’s vice-president for regulatory affairs, wrote. “Ultimately, while these changes presumably satisfy Epic, they will cause a range of unintended consequences that will harm American consumers, developers and device makers.” Federal antitrust scrutiny is also building. In August, Google lost a trial over claims by the US Justice Department that the company illegally monopolizes online search and advertising markets. The department is expected to detail its proposal Tuesday to alleviate the harm resulting from that misconduct — even as the agency is still sparring with Google in yet another case over the company’s alleged dominance over the technology used to buy and sell online ads. Closing arguments in that fight will be held in November with a decision expected by the end of the year. --With assistance from Rachel Graf and Julia Love.

{'title': 'Amazon stock sinks as Wells Fargo downgrades shares', 'content': 'Amazon ( ) stock closed 3% lower Monday as Wells Fargo ( ) analysts downgraded shares, noting that the company\'s strength in the cloud services market won’t be enough to stave off other hurdles to its profit margins. Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski downgraded the stock from Overweight to Equal Weight and lowered his price target for the stock from $225 to $183. "AMZN has been a consistent positive revision story, but we believe factors pressure revisions in the near term," he wrote in a note Monday. Challenges facing Amazon include rising competition from Walmart ( ), moderating contribution from its ad business to operating income, and high costs linked to its satellite broadband project. "Keeping these headwinds in context, Amazon remains a margin expansion story, just likely a more moderate margin expansion pace than the market expects," Gawrelski wrote. Gawrelski is one of only five Wall Street analysts who don’t recommend buying the popular stock, Bloomberg data shows. He sees shares priced at $187 over the next year. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts see Amazon stock rising over 20% to about $220, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Amazon’s most recent earnings report in early August  . But strength in its cloud services division, Amazon Web Services, has helped make up for weaker-than-expected growth in retail sales. AWS houses Amazon\'s AI services, and it generated $26.3 billion in revenue during the company’s second fiscal quarter, ahead of analysts’ forecasts and   than the year before. Its advertising segment also saw revenue surge 20%, but its $12.8 billion in sales reported for the three months ended June 30 fell just short of expectations. Amazon is part of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks that have posted massive gains over the past year thanks to investor hype over generative artificial intelligence. Amazon stock is up 42% from last year. The rapid expansion of Amazon Web Services has mirrored the AI trend. Amazon’s AWS segment has launched a host of AI tools for developers and consumers over the past year. AWS is making more money renting space in its far-off data centers to customers looking to power hungry AI software. Amazon expects AI to generate billions of dollars of revenue in the coming years. But Wells Fargo thinks advancements in the AI space won’t be enough to offset downsides from Amazon’s other businesses, which could hinder its profit growth. Wells Fargo’s Gawrelski said rising competition from Walmart’s burgeoning fulfillment services business will put pressure on the fees Amazon can charge merchants for storing, packing, and shipping their products. Gawrelski noted that Walmart’s fulfillment offerings for sellers are about 15% cheaper. If Amazon is forced to lower its fees, that would cut into its income from its retail segment. Meanwhile, Amazon’s  , its initiative to become a satellite broadband internet service provider and rival to SpaceX’s Starlink, will shave $3 billion off its operating income in 2025 and 2026, Gawrelski estimated. He added that Amazon’s advertising sales will grow at a “much more modest pace” between 2025 and 2027. Also on Monday, a judge   that the Federal Trade Commission\'s antitrust case against Amazon will move forward. Wells Fargo sees Amazon beating expectations in the third quarter. The company raised its third quarter outlook for Amazon’s earnings per share from $1.18 to $1.26, well above the consensus estimate of $1.15, according to Bloomberg data.', 'date': '2024-10-07', 'time': '20:09:31.000', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-stock-sinks-as-wells-fargo-downgrades-shares-200931181.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGGpALlXLruhtONK4m_HHsSmrifB7zI1i2N0KuGC74_jAkQCtIGgHWa9AHtTf9Dip9v-5TMfXGvTCBCS8QuQ2XOipnUxufLjGw3pubIo4GxzC2C2YHVX-cJnbs9qtqM8qdpygQOWXpPe9tdbK4azz3m2HfMPVc17MBXlOEb-4PQ2'}

{'title': '49-Year-Old Earning $1,000 a Week in Dividends With $927,892 Shares Portfolio: Top 8 Stocks and ETFs', 'content': 'Dividend investing is rising in   as investors seek stability and consistent income. Reliable dividend stocks reward investors even when times are tough. According to data from BlackRock, stocks of companies that regularly raise their dividends outperformed non-growers from 1978 through 2023. But which   can help you reach a decent income level without risks? Let\'s look at a success story for some ideas. About two months ago, a dividend investor on r/Dividend (a community of over 580,000 members on Reddit) shared that he reached a $1,000 per week dividend income milestone after 15 years of investing. The investor said his portfolio, which generates $1,000 a week, was worth $927,892. This makes it a portfolio with a strong 5.6% yield. Asked how he accumulated this wealth for investing, the Redditor said he has owned a small business (IT consulting) since 2015, and "every spare penny" he made was invested in stocks, bonds, CDs, and HYSA. "I clear about $250,000 a year from my business (pre-tax)," he added. It\'s also important to highlight that the investor said he\'s single and has no mortgage or debt. Someone asked the investor how much he contributed to investing every month. Here is the response. "Around $5,000 a month, give or take – I’ve been able to do that for about five years now." The Redditor also explained the key motivation behind his investing journey: "I remember my mom once saying that my father never had the opportunity to enjoy retirement (he passed away) – that stuck with me. So if I can get out early and have a comfortable life, sign me up," he said. While not everyone can contribute $5,000 per month to investing, we can all take inspiration and stock ideas from his success story and portfolio. Here are some of the stocks and ETFs in this high-yield dividend portfolio, which the investor shared publicly. Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: ) is perhaps one of the safest dividend stocks in the market, with over six decades of consecutive dividend increases and a solid business. In late August, Morgan Stanley increased its price target for Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: ) to $78 from $70 and called it a top pick. Morgan Stanley believes the company is positioned well to see strong organic sales compared to industry peers. It\'s not common to see Wendy’s Co (NASDAQ: ) in the portfolios of Redditors making long-term dividend income. However, the Redditor making about $1,000 per week in dividends said the fast-food chain\'s stock was among his notable holdings. WEN yields about 5.7%. PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ: ) has a dividend yield of about 3.2% and over 50 consecutive years of dividend increases. Like Coca-Cola, it\'s considered a defensive stock that investors like for all market cycles. The Redditor making $1,000 weekly in dividends mentioned PEP among his notable stock holdings. Nuveen Preferred & Income Opportunities Fund (NYSE: ) invests mostly in stocks and other investments to generate income, including bonds. Some of the fund’s top holdings include Barclays, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Truist. JPC pays monthly dividends and yields over 7%. JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSE: ) has become a no-brainer investment among Redditors looking to invest in dividend ETFs for the long term. JEPI makes money by investing in some of the most notable large-cap U.S. stocks and selling call options. JEPI is ideal for those looking for exposure to defensive stocks. JEPI usually underperforms during bull markets but protects investors against huge losses during bear markets, as most of its portfolio consists of large, defensive equities like Trane Technologies PLC (NYSE: ), Southern Co (NYSE: ), Progressive Corp (NYSE: ), among many others. The fund pays a monthly dividend and yields about 7%. The Redditor earning $1,000 a week in dividends counted JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ: ) among the top ETFs in his portfolio. JEPQ invests in Nasdaq companies and generates extra income by selling call options. As of Oct. 2, the ETF yielded about 9%. Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (NYSE: ) is a floating-rate income fund that generates income by investing in adjustable-rate loans. The fund yields about 11%. However, floating-rate funds are usually attractive when interest rates are rising. The Redditor earning about $1,000 per week in dividends said he owned just 118 shares of Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE: ). The ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and exposes you to some of the top dividend stocks trading in the U.S., including Home Depot, Coca-Cola, Verizon, Lockheed Martin, Pepsi, and AbbVie, among many others.

{'title': 'Oil edges lower after rallying to highest in over a month on Middle East war risk', 'content': "(Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower in early Asian trading hours on Tuesday as traders booked profits after prices rallied to their highest in over a month on Monday amid fears that the Middle East could be on the brink of a region-wide war. Fighting in the Middle East intensified after Iran-backed Hezbollah fired rockets at Israel's third-largest city, Haifa, and Israel looked poised to expand its offensive into Lebanon, a year after the Hamas attack on Israel that sparked the Israel's ongoing war in Gaza. Brent crude futures fell 23 cents, or 0.3%, to $80.70 per barrel by 0029 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures fell 20 cents, or 0.3%, to $76.94 a barrel. Both contracts rose over 3% on Monday to hit their highest levels since late-August, adding to last week's rally that saw them rise by over 8% for the biggest weekly gains in over a year. The rally began after Iran launched a missile barrage on Israel on Oct. 1. Israel has sworn to retaliate and is weighing its options, with Iran's oil facilities considered a possible target. However, some analysts believe that an attack on Iranian oil infrastructure is unlikely and have warned that oil prices could face considerable downward pressure if Israel focuses on any other target. Even if an attack targets Iranian oil facilities, there is 7 million barrels per day of spare supply capacity within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to make up for the loss of its oil output, ANZ Bank analysts noted on Friday. Meanwhile, Hurricane Milton intensified into a Category 5 storm on its way to Florida after forcing at least one oil and gas platform in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to shut on Monday. U.S. crude oil inventories are expected to rise by 1.9 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 4, according to a preliminary Reuters poll. The American Petroleum Institute is due to post its tally of U.S. stockpiles at 2030 GMT on Tuesday, followed by the official tally from the Energy Information Administration at 1430 GMT on Wednesday.
